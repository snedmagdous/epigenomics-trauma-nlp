involuntary re experience of the traumatic event  \n avoidance of trauma associated stimuli   negative alteration in mood and cognition   and \n alteration in arousal reactivity    while most individual be expose to a potentially traumatic \n event at some point in their life   only a small subset develop ptsd    this suggest that trauma \n exposure be necessary   but not sufficient   for the pathogenesis of ptsd   and that many other pre \n exist factor   include genetic background   play an influential role in determine individual \n response to trauma    \n ptsd be a complex syndrome with a great degree of heterogeneity in presentation within \n and across population    similarly   biological correlate associate with ptsd   specifically dna \n methylation   dnam   and gene expression profile   exhibit tissue specificity and be comprise \n of two dynamic component   1   profile reflect cellular composition and 2   alteration in \n dnam level at cpg site and transcriptional activity    in this work   I examine dna \n methylation and gene expression profile that reflect the pathophysiology of ptsd while \n consider fundamental population context and source of heterogeneity that have not be \n adequately address in the exist ptsd literature    sex   ancestry   and cellular composition    \n after an overview of relevant literature in chapter 1   the subsequent two chapter \n examine sex specific profile associate with ptsd    chapter 2 disentangle the contribution of \n cellular composition from dnam alteration in methylomic profile to discern sex specific \n leukocyte composition associate with ptsd use a combine dataset from two independent \n cohort    chapter 3 assess the relationship between blood and brain transcriptomic profile in a \n iii \n rat model of ptsd   I e    individual response to recent trauma exposure   use a publicly \n available expression dataset    chapter 4 implement an integrative system level approach to \n investigate the genomic context underlie leukocyte methylomic and transcriptomic profile in \n an understudied   at risk population of african ancestry   and to identify regulatory epigenetic \n mark that putatively regulate leukocyte gene expression in ptsd    chapter 5 provide a \n discussion of the implication of these finding and their contribution to the exist ptsd \n literature    \n this work use genomic approach to generate mechanistic hypothesis regard \n dysregulation observe in ptsd    it contribute novel insight to the current ptsd literature by \n consider sex    ancestry    and cell tissue specific context   which have historically be \n overlook   and by do so provide input for understand finding that be often inconsistent \n across publish dna methylation and gene expression study of ptsd    \n \n \n \n iv \n acknowledgment \n \n \n to my knowledge   the vast majority of phds do not consider their phd experience to \n have be a cake walk    there seem to be a set of typical and less typical   but not necessarily \n surprising   challenge phd student encounter   find personally try   and handle deal with in \n their own way    despite recognize that many other graduate have similar struggle and also \n seriously consider drop out at multiple point during their training   I still truly believe my \n thesis completion phd be a miracle that could not have be possible without a number of \n people who demonstrate an enormous amount of patience   compassion   and understand over \n my year of graduate training    \n first and foremost   I thank my advisor   monica uddin   for her support guidance and for \n stick with I for the last four and a half years    she deserve much credit for the completion \n of this dissertation    when I be at my wit   end and have completely deplete all \n mental emotional reserve   she manage to talk I back into roll forward again    she figure \n I out and convince I that I be really close and that the rest of the road be pave flat    in \n reality   there be a lot leave to do in the last abd year   but I didn t need to know that at the time  \n she know my tendency and coach I to the finish line accord to my specific need    \n I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to the rest of my doctoral committee  \n prof   rodney johnson   janice juraska   and lisa stubbs",

health problem   with a worrying recent increase in \n suicide rate in both adolescent and adult population   however   it be essential to recognize that \n suicide be preventable   a myriad of factor contribute to an individual s vulnerability to suicide \n these factor include various potential cause   from psychiatric disorder to genetic and epigenetic \n alteration   these change can induce dysfunction in crucial system such as the serotonergic \n cannabinoid   and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis   in addition   early life experience of abuse \n can profoundly impact an individual s ability to cope with stress   ultimately lead to change in \n the in\ufb02ammatory system   which be a signi\ufb01cant risk factor for suicidal behavior   thus   it be clear \n that suicidal behavior may result from a con\ufb02uence of multiple factor   this review examine the \n primary risk factor associate with suicidal behavior   include psychiatric disorder   early life \n adversity   and

paramount \n however   it be crucial to recognize that many factor in\ufb02uence an individual s risk of suicide \n the link between suicide and mental disorder be well establish   psychiatric disor

\u2002  while research have identify racial trauma in other context   it be often overlook amongst cana \n dian society   racial trauma occur as a result of an event of racism or cumulative event over time whereby an individual \n experience stress and consequent mental health sequelae   give that the bipoc   black   indigenous   and or person of \n colour   population in canada be increase   it be imperative to identify racial discrimination and the subsequent stress and \n trauma associate with be racialize in canada   which subject bipoc canadians to various form of racism   include \n microaggression \n recent finding \u2002  this paper review the publish literature on racism and racial discrimination that identify or infer racial \n trauma as the source of the mental health implication for various group   e g    indigenous people   black canadians   asian \n canadians   immigrant   and refugee    in addition   intersectionality of racialize person be prominent to their psychological \n well be as their psychosocial and socioeconomic position be complex   therefore   this paper both provide insight into the \n canadian experience as a person of colour and signify the need for further research on racial trauma in a canadian context \n summary \u2002  despite canada s emphasis on multiculturalism   racialize individual be at risk for racial trauma due to prejudice

of all \n canadians   fig \u00a0 1  \n canadian society be often consider to be   colourblind  \n meaning it do not see or take race into consideration  \n many canadian describe themselves as
