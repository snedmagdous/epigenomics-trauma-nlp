"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Cancer Survival: The Contribution of Tumor, Sociodemographic, Institutional, and Neighborhood Characteristics.","Purpose Racial/ethnic disparities in cancer survival in the United States are well documented, but the underlying causes are not well understood. We quantified the contribution of tumor, treatment, hospital, sociodemographic, and neighborhood factors to racial/ethnic survival disparities in California. Materials and Methods California Cancer Registry data were used to estimate population-based cancer-specific survival for patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer between 2000 and 2013 for each racial/ethnic group (non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and separately each for Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino) compared with non-Hispanic whites. The percentage contribution of factors to overall racial/ethnic survival disparities was estimated from a sequence of multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results In baseline models, black patients had the lowest survival for all cancer sites, and Asian American and Pacific Islander patients had the highest, compared with whites. Mediation analyses suggested that stage at diagnosis had the greatest influence on overall racial/ethnic survival disparities accounting for 24% of disparities in breast cancer, 24% in prostate cancer, and 16% to 30% in colorectal cancer. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was an important factor in all cancers, but only for black and Hispanic patients. The influence of marital status on racial/ethnic disparities was stronger in men than in women. Adjustment for all covariables explained approximately half of the overall survival disparities in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, but it explained only 15% to 40% of disparities in lung cancer. Conclusion Overall reductions in racial/ethnic survival disparities were driven largely by reductions for black compared with white patients. Stage at diagnosis had the largest effect on racial/ethnic survival disparities, but earlier detection would not entirely eliminate them. The influences of neighborhood socioeconomic status and marital status suggest that social determinants, support mechanisms, and access to health care are important contributing factors.",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,"[""purpose"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""cancer"", ""survival"", ""united"", ""state"", ""well"", ""document"", ""underlie"", ""cause"", ""well"", ""understand"", ""quantify"", ""contribution"", ""tumor"", ""treatment"", ""hospital"", ""sociodemographic"", ""neighborhood"", ""factor"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""survival"", ""disparity"", ""california"", ""material"", ""method"", ""california"", ""cancer"", ""registry"", ""datum"", ""use"", ""estimate"", ""population"", ""base"", ""cancer"", ""specific"", ""survival"", ""patient"", ""diagnose"", ""breast"", ""prostate"", ""colorectal"", ""lung"", ""cancer"", ""2000"", ""2013"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""american"", ""pacific"", ""islander"", ""separately"", ""chinese"", ""japanese"", ""filipino"", ""compare"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""percentage"", ""contribution"", ""factor"", ""overall"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""survival"", ""disparity"", ""estimate"", ""sequence"", ""multivariable"", ""cox"", ""proportional"", ""hazard"", ""model"", ""baseline"", ""model"", ""black"", ""patient"", ""low"", ""survival"", ""cancer"", ""site"", ""asian"", ""american"", ""pacific"", ""islander"", ""patient"", ""highest"", ""compare"", ""white"", ""mediation"", ""analysis"", ""suggest"", ""stage"", ""diagnosis"", ""great"", ""influence"", ""overall"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""survival"", ""disparity"", ""account"", ""24"", ""disparity"", ""breast"", ""cancer"", ""24"", ""prostate"", ""cancer"", ""16"", ""30"", ""colorectal"", ""cancer"", ""neighborhood"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""important"", ""factor"", ""cancer"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""patient"", ""influence"", ""marital"", ""status"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""strong"", ""man"", ""woman"", ""adjustment"", ""covariable"", ""explain"", ""approximately"", ""half"", ""overall"", ""survival"", ""disparity"", ""breast"", ""prostate"", ""colorectal"", ""cancer"", ""explain"", ""15"", ""40"", ""disparity"", ""lung"", ""cancer"", ""conclusion"", ""overall"", ""reduction"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""survival"", ""disparity"", ""drive"", ""largely"", ""reduction"", ""black"", ""compare"", ""white"", ""patient"", ""stage"", ""diagnosis"", ""large"", ""effect"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""survival"", ""disparity"", ""early"", ""detection"", ""would"", ""entirely"", ""eliminate"", ""influence"", ""neighborhood"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""marital"", ""status"", ""suggest"", ""social"", ""determinant"", ""support"", ""mechanism"", ""access"", ""health"", ""care"", ""important"", ""contribute"", ""factor""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,"Asian, Hispanic"

Association of Socioeconomic Status With Life's Essential 8 Varies by Race and Ethnicity.,"Background The American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 (LE8) are 8 risk factors for cardiovascular disease, with poor attainment across all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups. Attainment is lowest among Americans of low socioeconomic status (SES). Evidence suggests the association of SES with LE8 may vary by race and ethnicity. Methods and Results The association of 4 SES categories (education, income-to-poverty line ratio, employment, insurance) with LE8 was computed in age-adjusted linear regression models, with an interaction term for race and ethnicity, using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, years 2011 to 2018. The sample (n=13 529) had a median age of 48 years (51% female) with weighting to be representative of the US population. The magnitude of positive association of college education (relative to ≤high school) with LE8 was greater among non-Hispanic White Americans (NHWA) compared with non-Hispanic Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and non-Hispanic Asian Americans (all interactions <i>P</i><0.001). NHWA had a greater magnitude of positive association of income-to-poverty line ratio with LE8, compared with non-Hispanic Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and non-Hispanic Asian Americans (all interactions <i>P</i><0.001). NHWA with Medicaid compared with private insurance had a greater magnitude of negative association with LE8 compared with non-Hispanic Black Americans, non-Hispanic Asian Americans, or Hispanic Americans (all interactions <i>P</i><0.01). NHWA unemployed due to disability or health condition (compared with employed) had a greater magnitude of negative association with LE8 than non-Hispanic Black Americans, non-Hispanic Asian Americans, or Hispanic Americans (all interactions <i>P</i><0.05). Conclusions The magnitude of association of SES with LE8 is greatest among NHWA.

Racial Differences in Cancer Susceptibility and Survival: More Than the Color of the Skin?,"Epidemiological studies point to race as a determining factor in cancer susceptibility. In US registries recording cancer incidence and survival by race (distinguishing 'black versus white'), individuals of African ancestry have a globally increased risk of malignancies compared with Caucasians and Asian Americans. Differences in socioeconomic status and health-care access play a key role. However, the lesser disease susceptibility of Hispanic populations with comparable lifestyles and socioeconomic status as African Americans (Hispanic paradox) points to the concomitant importance of genetic determinants. Here, we overview the molecular basis of racial disparity in cancer susceptibility ranging from genetic polymorphisms and cancer-driver gene mutations to obesity, chronic inflammation, and immune responses. We discuss implications for race-adapted cancer screening programs and clinical trials to reduce disparities in cancer burden.",Trends in cancer,"[""epidemiological"", ""study"", ""point"", ""race"", ""determining"", ""factor"", ""cancer"", ""susceptibility"", ""we"", ""registry"", ""record"", ""cancer"", ""incidence"", ""survival"", ""race"", ""distinguish"", ""black"", ""versus"", ""white"", ""individual"", ""african"", ""ancestry"", ""globally"", ""increase"", ""risk"", ""malignancy"", ""compare"", ""caucasian"", ""asian"", ""american"", ""difference"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""health"", ""care"", ""access"", ""play"", ""key"", ""role"", ""however"", ""less"", ""disease"", ""susceptibility"", ""hispanic"", ""population"", ""comparable"", ""lifestyle"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""african"", ""american"", ""hispanic"", ""paradox"", ""point"", ""concomitant"", ""importance"", ""genetic"", ""determinant"", ""overview"", ""molecular"", ""basis"", ""racial"", ""disparity"", ""cancer"", ""susceptibility"", ""range"", ""genetic"", ""polymorphism"", ""cancer"", ""driver"", ""gene"", ""mutation"", ""obesity"", ""chronic"", ""inflammation"", ""immune"", ""response"", ""discuss"", ""implication"", ""race"", ""adapt"", ""cancer"", ""screening"", ""program"", ""clinical"", ""trial"", ""reduce"", ""disparity"", ""cancer"", ""burden""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,"Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic"
Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Mutual Help Group Participation for Substance Use Problems.,"Mutual help groups are a ubiquitous component of the substance abuse treatment system in the United States, showing demonstrated effectiveness as a treatment adjunct; so, it is paramount to understand whether they are as appealing to, and as effective for, racial or ethnic minority groups as they are for Whites. Nonetheless, no known comprehensive reviews have examined whether there are racial/ethnic disparities in mutual help group participation. Accordingly, this study comprehensively reviewed the U.S. literature on racial/ethnic disparities in mutual help participation among adults and adolescents with substance use disorder treatment need. The study identified 19 articles comparing mutual help participation across specific racial/ethnic minority groups and Whites, including eight national epidemiological studies and 11 treatment/community studies. Most compared Latinx and/or Black adults to White adults, and all but two analyzed 12-step participation, with others examining ""self-help"" attendance. Across studies, racial/ethnic comparisons yielded mostly null (<i>N</i> = 17) and mixed (<i>N</i> = 9) effects, though some findings were consistent with a racial/ethnic disparity (<i>N</i> = 6) or minority advantage (<i>N</i> = 3). Findings were weakly suggestive of disparities for Latinx populations (especially immigrants, women, and adolescents) as well as for Black women and adolescents.

A window into racial and socioeconomic status disparities in preschool disciplinary action using developmental methodology.,"There are large differences in expulsions and suspensions on the basis of race starting in preschool and divergent explanations for their cause. The current study explores how developmental methodology can shed light on this vexing issue. We leverage two measures: (1) childcare provider complaints about children's behavior and their recommended disciplinary action (measured by parent report); and (2) observed disruptive behavior measured by a laboratory-based standardized observation tool, the Disruptive Behavior Diagnostic Observation Schedule (DB-DOS), among a large, sociodemographically diverse sample of children (n  <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><semantics><mi>=</mi><annotation>$\text{=}$</annotation></semantics></math>  430; mean age  <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><semantics><mi>=</mi><annotation>$\text{=}$</annotation></semantics></math>  4.79 years). We identified three latent class profiles on the basis of race/socioeconomic status (SES) and found disparities in childcare provider complaints based on profile membership. More specifically, children classified in the Black/Hispanic, poor and Black, nonpoor profiles both had significantly higher childcare provider complaints compared with children in the White/Hispanic, nonpoor profile. By contrast, there were no differences in observed disruptive behavior based on race/SES profiles. Finally, childcare provider complaints in preschool were associated with lower cognitive performance in elementary school, above and beyond observed disruptive behavior in preschool and race/SES profiles.

Impact of sex and ethnicity on arrhythmic risk.,"Substantial differences in the risk of common arrhythmia syndromes exist between men and women, as well as in varying ethnic/racial groups. For example, despite an overall lower risk of sudden death and atrial fibrillation in women compared with men, women have longer QT intervals and a higher risk of torsades de pointes due to antiarrhythmic drugs and worse outcomes associated with atrial fibrillation. An ethnicity-related paradox in atrial fibrillation epidemiology is apparent; despite a higher prevalence of medical comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and prolonged PR interval, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians have a lower risk of atrial fibrillation than whites.

Race/ethnicity and measurement equivalence of the Everyday Discrimination Scale.,"The present study examines the effect of race/ethnicity on measurement equivalence of the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS; Williams, Yu, Jackson, & Anderson, 1997). Drawn from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES; Alegría, Jackson, Kessler, & Takeuchi, 2008), adults aged 18 and older from four racial/ethnic groups were selected for analyses: 884 non-Hispanic Whites, 4,950 Blacks, 2,733 Hispanics/Latinos, and 2,089 Asians. Multiple-group confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. After adjusting for age and gender, the underlying construct of the EDS was invariant across four racial/ethnic groups, with Item 7 (""People act as if they're better than you are"") associated with lower intercepts for the Hispanic/Latino and Asian groups relative to the non-Hispanic White and Black groups.

When and How Do Students Benefit From Ethnic Diversity in Middle School?,"The effects of school-based ethnic diversity on student well-being and race-related views were examined during the first year in middle school. To capture the dynamic nature of ethnic exposure, diversity was assessed both at the school-level (n = 26) and based on academic course enrollments of African American, Asian, Latino, and White students (n = 4,302; M = 11.33 years). Across all four pan-ethnic groups, school-level ethnic diversity was associated with lower sense of vulnerability (i.e., feeling safer, less victimized, and less lonely) as well as perceptions of teachers' fair and equal treatment of ethnic groups and lower out-group distance. Underscoring the role of individual experiences, exposure to diversity in academic classes moderated the association between school-level diversity and the two aforementioned race-related views.",Child development,"[""effect"", ""school"", ""base"", ""ethnic"", ""diversity"", ""student"", ""well"", ""race"", ""related"", ""view"", ""examine"", ""first"", ""year"", ""middle"", ""school"", ""capture"", ""dynamic"", ""nature"", ""ethnic"", ""exposure"", ""diversity"", ""assess"", ""school"", ""level"", ""n"", ""26"", ""base"", ""academic"", ""course"", ""enrollment"", ""african"", ""american"", ""asian"", ""latino"", ""white"", ""student"", ""n"", ""4"", ""302"", ""11"", ""33"", ""year"", ""across"", ""four"", ""pan"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""school"", ""level"", ""ethnic"", ""diversity"", ""associate"", ""low"", ""sense"", ""vulnerability"", ""e"", ""feel"", ""safer"", ""less"", ""victimize"", ""less"", ""lonely"", ""well"", ""perception"", ""teacher"", ""fair"", ""equal"", ""treatment"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""low"", ""group"", ""distance"", ""underscore"", ""role"", ""individual"", ""experience"", ""exposure"", ""diversity"", ""academic"", ""class"", ""moderate"", ""association"", ""school"", ""level"", ""diversity"", ""two"", ""aforementioned"", ""race"", ""related"", ""view""]",None,None,None,"Latino, Asian"
"Race Matters: Income Shares, Income Inequality, and Income Mobility for All U.S. Races.","Using unique linked data, we examine income inequality and mobility across racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Our data encompass the universe of income tax filers in the United States for the period 2000-2014, matched with individual-level race and ethnicity information from multiple censuses and American Community Survey data. We document both income inequality and mobility trends over the period. We find significant stratification in terms of average incomes by racial/ethnic group and distinct differences in within-group income inequality. The groups with the highest incomes-whites and Asians-also have the highest levels of within-group inequality and the lowest levels of within-group mobility. The reverse is true for the lowest-income groups: blacks, American Indians, and Hispanics have lower within-group inequality and immobility. On the other hand, low-income groups are also highly immobile in terms of overall, rather than within-group, mobility. These same groups also have a higher probability of experiencing downward mobility compared with whites and Asians. We also find that within-group income inequality increased for all groups between 2000 and 2014, and the increase was especially large for whites. The picture that emerges from our analysis is of a rigid income structure, with mainly whites and Asians positioned at the top and blacks, American Indians, and Hispanics confined to the bottom.",Demography,"[""use"", ""unique"", ""link"", ""datum"", ""examine"", ""income"", ""inequality"", ""mobility"", ""across"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""unite"", ""state"", ""datum"", ""encompass"", ""universe"", ""income"", ""tax"", ""filer"", ""unite"", ""state"", ""period"", ""2000"", ""2014"", ""match"", ""individual"", ""level"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""information"", ""multiple"", ""census"", ""american"", ""community"", ""survey"", ""datum"", ""document"", ""income"", ""inequality"", ""mobility"", ""trend"", ""period"", ""find"", ""stratification"", ""term"", ""average"", ""income"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""distinct"", ""difference"", ""within"", ""group"", ""income"", ""inequality"", ""group"", ""high"", ""income"", ""white"", ""asian"", ""also"", ""high"", ""level"", ""within"", ""group"", ""inequality"", ""low"", ""level"", ""within"", ""group"", ""mobility"", ""reverse"", ""true"", ""low"", ""income"", ""group"", ""black"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""hispanic"", ""low"", ""within"", ""group"", ""inequality"", ""immobility"", ""hand"", ""low"", ""income"", ""group"", ""also"", ""highly"", ""immobile"", ""term"", ""overall"", ""rather"", ""within"", ""group"", ""mobility"", ""group"", ""also"", ""high"", ""probability"", ""experience"", ""downward"", ""mobility"", ""compared"", ""white"", ""asian"", ""also"", ""find"", ""within"", ""group"", ""income"", ""inequality"", ""increase"", ""group"", ""2000"", ""2014"", ""increase"", ""especially"", ""large"", ""white"", ""picture"", ""emerge"", ""analysi"", ""rigid"", ""income"", ""structure"", ""mainly"", ""white"", ""asian"", ""positioned"", ""top"", ""black"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""hispanic"", ""confine"", ""bottom""]",None,None,income inequality,"Asian, Hispanic"
"Race, disability, and grade: Social relationships in children with autism spectrum disorders.","Race is associated with social relationships among typically developing children; however, studies rarely examine the impact of race on social outcomes for children with autism spectrum disorder. This study examined how race (African American, Latino, Asian, or White) in conjunction with disability status (autism spectrum disorders or typically developing) and grade (grades K-2 or 3-5) affects friendships and social networks. The sample comprises 85 children with autism spectrum disorders and 85 typically developing controls matched on race, gender, age/grade, and classroom (wherever possible). Race, disability, and grade each had an independent effect on friendship nominations, and there was an interaction among the three variables. Specifically, children with autism spectrum disorders who were African American or Latino in the upper elementary grades received fewer friendship nominations than typically developing White children in the lower elementary grades. Only the presence of autism spectrum disorders was associated with social network centrality. Our results also suggested that Latino children with autism spectrum disorders in the upper elementary grades were at the highest risk of social isolation.

Persistent disparities in affordable rental housing among America's ethnoracial groups.,"Housing and residential outcomes in the United States are significantly stratified by ethnoracial group, but the extent to which disparities exist in affordable renting over time is less clear. In this study, I explore affordable housing disparities among White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian renters and test hypotheses regarding variation by education, local ethnoracial composition, and chosen measurement of affordability. Chiefly, I find that White households have higher rates of affordable housing than Black and Hispanic households with disparities remaining nearly identical between 2005 and 2019 and become larger when considering household's ability to afford other basic needs. Nevertheless, returns to education are not uniformly larger for White renters, in that Black and Asian renters experience larger marginal increases in residual income based affordable housing at higher levels of education. The effects of county ethnoracial composition effects are consistent with all groups-including White households-experiencing declining affordability when living in counties with large coethnic populations.",Social science research,"[""housing"", ""residential"", ""outcome"", ""unite"", ""state"", ""significantly"", ""stratify"", ""ethnoracial"", ""group"", ""extent"", ""disparity"", ""exist"", ""affordable"", ""renting"", ""time"", ""less"", ""clear"", ""explore"", ""affordable"", ""housing"", ""disparity"", ""among"", ""white"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""renter"", ""test"", ""hypothesis"", ""regard"", ""variation"", ""education"", ""local"", ""ethnoracial"", ""composition"", ""choose"", ""measurement"", ""affordability"", ""chiefly"", ""find"", ""white"", ""household"", ""high"", ""rate"", ""affordable"", ""housing"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""household"", ""disparity"", ""remain"", ""nearly"", ""identical"", ""2005"", ""2019"", ""become"", ""large"", ""consider"", ""household"", ""ability"", ""afford"", ""basic"", ""need"", ""nevertheless"", ""return"", ""education"", ""uniformly"", ""large"", ""white"", ""renter"", ""black"", ""asian"", ""renter"", ""experience"", ""large"", ""marginal"", ""increase"", ""residual"", ""income"", ""base"", ""affordable"", ""housing"", ""high"", ""level"", ""education"", ""effect"", ""county"", ""ethnoracial"", ""composition"", ""effect"", ""consistent"", ""group"", ""include"", ""white"", ""household"", ""experience"", ""decline"", ""affordability"", ""living"", ""county"", ""large"", ""coethnic"", ""population""]",None,None,None,"Black, Asian, Hispanic"
Defining Social Class Across Time and Between Groups.,"We examined changes over four decades and between ethnic groups in how people define their social class. Changes included the increasing importance of income, decreasing importance of occupational prestige, and the demise of the ""Victorian bargain,"" in which poor people who subscribed to conservative sexual and religious norms could think of themselves as middle class. The period also saw changes (among Whites) and continuity (among Black Americans) in subjective status perceptions. For Whites (and particularly poor Whites), their perceptions of enhanced social class were greatly reduced. Poor Whites now view their social class as slightly but significantly lower than their poor Black and Latino counterparts. For Black respondents, a caste-like understanding of social class persisted, as they continued to view their class standing as relatively independent of their achieved education, income, and occupation. Such achievement indicators, however, predicted Black respondents' self-esteem more than they predicted self-esteem for any other group.",Personality & social psychology bulletin,"[""examine"", ""change"", ""four"", ""decade"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""people"", ""define"", ""social"", ""class"", ""change"", ""include"", ""increase"", ""importance"", ""income"", ""decrease"", ""importance"", ""occupational"", ""prestige"", ""demise"", ""victorian"", ""bargain"", ""poor"", ""people"", ""subscribe"", ""conservative"", ""sexual"", ""religious"", ""norm"", ""could"", ""think"", ""middle"", ""class"", ""period"", ""also"", ""see"", ""change"", ""among"", ""white"", ""continuity"", ""among"", ""black"", ""american"", ""subjective"", ""status"", ""perception"", ""white"", ""particularly"", ""poor"", ""white"", ""perception"", ""enhance"", ""social"", ""class"", ""greatly"", ""reduce"", ""poor"", ""white"", ""view"", ""social"", ""class"", ""slightly"", ""significantly"", ""low"", ""poor"", ""black"", ""latino"", ""counterpart"", ""black"", ""respondent"", ""caste"", ""like"", ""understand"", ""social"", ""class"", ""persist"", ""continued"", ""view"", ""class"", ""stand"", ""relatively"", ""independent"", ""achieve"", ""education"", ""income"", ""occupation"", ""achievement"", ""indicator"", ""however"", ""predict"", ""black"", ""respondent"", ""self"", ""esteem"", ""predict"", ""self"", ""esteem"", ""group""]",None,None,social class,"Black, Latino"
Depression in Racial and Ethnic Minorities: the Impact of Nativity and Discrimination.,"This research examines factors associated with lifetime major depressive disorder in racial and ethnic minorities residing in the USA, with an emphasis on the impact of nativity, discrimination, and health lifestyle behaviors. The Healthy Migrant Effect and Health Lifestyle Theory were used to inform the design of this project. The use of these frameworks not only provides insightful results but also expands their application in mental health disparities research. Logistic regression models were implemented to examine risk factors associated with lifetime major depressive disorder, comparing immigrants to their American-born counterparts as well as to American-born Whites. Data were derived from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (n = 17,249). Support was found for the hypothesis that certain immigrants, specifically Asian and Afro-Caribbean, have lower odds of depression as compared their non-immigrant counterparts. Although, Hispanic immigrants directionally had lower odds of depression, this finding was not statistically significant. Furthermore, engaging in excessive alcohol consumption was associated with higher rates of depression (odds ratio (OR) = 2.09, p < 0.001), and the effect of discrimination on depression was found to be significant, even when controlling for demographics. Of all racial and ethnic groups, foreign-born Afro-Caribbeans had the lowest rate of depression at 7 % followed by foreign-born Asians at 8 %.",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,"[""research"", ""examine"", ""factor"", ""associate"", ""lifetime"", ""major"", ""depressive"", ""disorder"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""reside"", ""usa"", ""emphasis"", ""impact"", ""nativity"", ""discrimination"", ""health"", ""lifestyle"", ""behavior"", ""healthy"", ""migrant"", ""effect"", ""health"", ""lifestyle"", ""theory"", ""use"", ""inform"", ""design"", ""project"", ""use"", ""framework"", ""provide"", ""insightful"", ""also"", ""expand"", ""application"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""disparity"", ""research"", ""logistic"", ""regression"", ""model"", ""implement"", ""examine"", ""risk"", ""factor"", ""associate"", ""lifetime"", ""major"", ""depressive"", ""disorder"", ""compare"", ""immigrant"", ""american"", ""bear"", ""counterpart"", ""well"", ""american"", ""bear"", ""white"", ""datum"", ""derive"", ""collaborative"", ""psychiatric"", ""epidemiology"", ""survey"", ""n"", ""17"", ""249"", ""support"", ""find"", ""hypothesis"", ""certain"", ""immigrant"", ""specifically"", ""asian"", ""afro"", ""caribbean"", ""low"", ""odd"", ""depression"", ""compare"", ""non"", ""immigrant"", ""counterpart"", ""although"", ""hispanic"", ""immigrant"", ""directionally"", ""low"", ""odd"", ""depression"", ""find"", ""statistically"", ""furthermore"", ""engage"", ""excessive"", ""alcohol"", ""consumption"", ""associate"", ""high"", ""rate"", ""depression"", ""odd"", ""ratio"", ""2"", ""09"", ""p"", ""0"", ""001"", ""effect"", ""discrimination"", ""depression"", ""find"", ""even"", ""control"", ""demographic"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""foreign"", ""bear"", ""afro"", ""caribbean"", ""low"", ""rate"", ""depression"", ""7"", ""follow"", ""foreign"", ""bear"", ""asian"", ""8""]",depression,aging,None,"Asian, Hispanic"

Adverse adult experiences and health outcomes: Racial and ethnic differences in a low-income sample.,"Extending research on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), this study aimed to investigate whether the prevalence of and outcomes associated with adverse adult experiences vary among racial and ethnic subgroups. Survey data were collected from 1566 low-income women in Wisconsin using the Adult Experiences Survey (AES). Ten major adult adversities were assessed, including items that reference an intimate partner or household member (e.g., physical or emotional abuse, substance use) along with other social and economic stressors such as homelessness and discrimination. Adverse adult experiences were highly prevalent overall, but even more so among non-Hispanic Whites than their Black and Hispanic counterparts. The results reinforce prior research on ACEs in low-income populations. Lending further credence to these findings, tests of measurement invariance indicated that the AES demonstrated acceptable configural and scalar invariance across racial and ethnic groups. As expected, greater exposure to adult adversity was significantly related to poorer physical and mental health. These associations manifested cross-sectionally and longitudinally for observed and latent measures of adult adversity-even after controlling for ACEs. Associations between adult adversity and health were not moderated by race/ethnicity. In sum, adverse adult experiences were unequally distributed across racial/ethnic groups, but the consequences associated with adversity appeared to be evenly dispersed.",Stress and health : journal of the International Society for the Investigation of Stress,"[""extend"", ""research"", ""adverse"", ""childhood"", ""experience"", ""ace"", ""aim"", ""investigate"", ""whether"", ""prevalence"", ""outcome"", ""associate"", ""adverse"", ""adult"", ""experience"", ""vary"", ""among"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""subgroup"", ""survey"", ""datum"", ""collect"", ""1566"", ""low"", ""income"", ""woman"", ""wisconsin"", ""use"", ""adult"", ""experience"", ""survey"", ""ae"", ""ten"", ""major"", ""adult"", ""adversity"", ""assess"", ""include"", ""item"", ""reference"", ""intimate"", ""partner"", ""household"", ""member"", ""e"", ""g"", ""physical"", ""emotional"", ""abuse"", ""substance"", ""use"", ""along"", ""social"", ""economic"", ""stressor"", ""homelessness"", ""discrimination"", ""adverse"", ""adult"", ""experience"", ""highly"", ""prevalent"", ""overall"", ""even"", ""among"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""counterpart"", ""reinforce"", ""prior"", ""research"", ""ace"", ""low"", ""income"", ""population"", ""lend"", ""credence"", ""finding"", ""test"", ""measurement"", ""invariance"", ""indicate"", ""aes"", ""demonstrate"", ""acceptable"", ""configural"", ""scalar"", ""invariance"", ""across"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""expect"", ""great"", ""exposure"", ""adult"", ""adversity"", ""significantly"", ""relate"", ""poorer"", ""physical"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""association"", ""manifest"", ""cross"", ""sectionally"", ""longitudinally"", ""observe"", ""latent"", ""measure"", ""adult"", ""adversity"", ""even"", ""control"", ""ace"", ""association"", ""adult"", ""adversity"", ""health"", ""moderated"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""sum"", ""adverse"", ""adult"", ""experience"", ""unequally"", ""distribute"", ""across"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""consequence"", ""associated"", ""adversity"", ""appear"", ""evenly"", ""disperse""]",None,None,None,"Black, Hispanic"

Assessing invariance across sex and race/ethnicity in measures of youth psychopathic characteristics.,"The aim of this study was to assess the measurement invariance of 2 commonly used measures of youth psychopathic characteristics across sex and racial/ethnic groups. Among a community sample of Hispanic and Black adolescents (N = 355; 50.5% female; mean age = 15.09) and their parents, this study tested the configural and metric invariance of the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP; Levenson, Fitzpatrick, & Kiehl, 1995) and the parent-report version of the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits (Frick, 2004). Preliminary analyses indicated that the adolescents in the present study reported similar rates of psychopathic characteristics as those reported by other studies of adolescents and young adults. Results of the multigroup invariance analyses indicated that these measures are invariant across sex and between Hispanic and Black youth. In addition, further analyses assessing associations between these measures and a number of behavioral and emotional characteristics indicated that scores on the LSRP Scale and Callous-Unemotional Traits demonstrate good convergent and discriminant validity with few differences by sex or race/ethnicity. To date, research on psychopathy has focused predominantly on samples of White males.

Racial and Ethnic Differences in Socioeconomic Position and Risk of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,"Racial and ethnic differences in associations between socioeconomic position (SEP) and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were investigated using data from population-based cancer registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program in the United States. The study included 8,383 ALL cases diagnosed at age ≤19 years in 2000-2010. Census tract-level composite SEP index in quintiles was assigned based on residence at the time of diagnosis. Incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals associated with SEP and race/ethnicity, adjusted for sex, age, and year of diagnosis, were estimated using Poisson regression models.

Ethnoracial disparities in cognition are associated with multiple socioeconomic status-stress pathways.,"Systemic racism can have broad impacts on health in ethnoracial minorities. One way is by suppressing socioeconomic status (SES) levels through barriers to achieve higher income, wealth, and educational attainment. Additionally, the weathering hypothesis proposes that the various stressful adversities faced by ethnoracial minorities lead to greater wear and tear on the body, known as allostatic load. In the present study, we extend these ideas to cognitive health in a tri-ethnic sample of young adults-when cognition and brain health is arguably at their peak. Specifically, we tested competing mediation models that might shed light on how two key factors caused by systemic racism-SES and perceived stress-intersect to explain ethnoracial disparities in cognition. We found evidence for partial mediation via a pathway from SES to stress on episodic memory, working memory capacity, and executive function in Black Americans relative to non-Hispanic White Americans. Additionally, we found that stress partially mediated the ethnoracial disparities in working memory updating for lower SES Black and Hispanic Americans relative to non-Hispanic White Americans, showing that higher SES can sometimes reduce the negative effects stress has on these disparities in some cognitive domains. Overall, these findings suggest that multiple pathways exist in which lower SES creates a stressful environment to impact ethnoracial disparities cognition. These pathways differ depending on the specific ethnoracial category and cognitive domain. The present results may offer insight into strategies to help mitigate the late-life risk for neurocognitive disorders in ethnoracial minorities.",Cognitive research: principles and implications,"[""systemic"", ""racism"", ""broad"", ""impact"", ""health"", ""ethnoracial"", ""minority"", ""one"", ""way"", ""suppress"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""ses"", ""level"", ""barrier"", ""achieve"", ""high"", ""income"", ""wealth"", ""educational"", ""attainment"", ""additionally"", ""weather"", ""hypothesis"", ""propose"", ""various"", ""stressful"", ""adversity"", ""face"", ""ethnoracial"", ""minority"", ""lead"", ""great"", ""wear"", ""tear"", ""body"", ""known"", ""allostatic"", ""load"", ""present"", ""extend"", ""idea"", ""cognitive"", ""health"", ""tri"", ""ethnic"", ""sample"", ""young"", ""adult"", ""cognition"", ""brain"", ""health"", ""arguably"", ""peak"", ""specifically"", ""test"", ""compete"", ""mediation"", ""model"", ""might"", ""shed"", ""light"", ""two"", ""key"", ""factor"", ""cause"", ""systemic"", ""racism"", ""se"", ""perceive"", ""stress"", ""intersect"", ""explain"", ""ethnoracial"", ""disparity"", ""cognition"", ""find"", ""evidence"", ""partial"", ""mediation"", ""via"", ""pathway"", ""se"", ""stress"", ""episodic"", ""memory"", ""working"", ""memory"", ""capacity"", ""executive"", ""function"", ""black"", ""american"", ""relative"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""american"", ""additionally"", ""find"", ""stress"", ""partially"", ""mediate"", ""ethnoracial"", ""disparity"", ""work"", ""memory"", ""update"", ""low"", ""ses"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""american"", ""relative"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""american"", ""show"", ""high"", ""se"", ""sometimes"", ""reduce"", ""negative"", ""effect"", ""stress"", ""disparity"", ""cognitive"", ""domain"", ""overall"", ""finding"", ""suggest"", ""multiple"", ""pathway"", ""exist"", ""low"", ""se"", ""create"", ""stressful"", ""environment"", ""impact"", ""ethnoracial"", ""disparity"", ""cognition"", ""pathway"", ""differ"", ""depend"", ""specific"", ""ethnoracial"", ""category"", ""cognitive"", ""domain"", ""present"", ""may"", ""offer"", ""insight"", ""strategy"", ""help"", ""mitigate"", ""late"", ""life"", ""risk"", ""neurocognitive"", ""disorder"", ""ethnoracial"", ""minority""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,"Black, Hispanic"

"Sex, Race, and Socioeconomic Disparities in Patients With Aortic Stenosis (from a Nationwide Inpatient Sample).","Aortic stenosis (AS) is the third most prevalent cardiovascular disease following hypertension and coronary artery disease. The primary objective of this cross-sectional study is to examine gender, racial, and socioeconomic disparities in AS-related health care utilization in patients aged ≥50 years using data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample. AS was identified among inpatient discharges with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, code 424.1. Using stratum-specific weighted totals, means, proportions, and regression models, we examined time trends and disparities for inhospital AS prevalence according to gender, race, and income over the 2002 to 2012 period, predictors of AS (gender, race, income, age, health insurance, co-morbidities, and hospital-level characteristics), and AS's role as a predictor of inhospital death, length of stay, and total charges. Inhospital AS prevalence increased from 2.10% in 2002 to 2.37% in 2012, with similar trends observed within gender, race, and income strata. Women were less likely to have AS compared with men (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 0.86). Blacks (ORadj 0.68; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.71), Hispanics (ORadj 0.79; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.84), and Asians/Pacific Islanders (ORadj 0.68; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.74) were less likely than whites to have AS diagnosis that was directly associated with income. AS was inversely related to inhospital death but positively linked to total charges overall and longer hospital stays among men, whites, and middle-income patients. However, shorter stays with AS were observed among blacks. In conclusion, among older inpatients, AS prevalence was ∼2% and was higher among males, whites, and higher income groups.

America's Churning Races: Race and Ethnicity Response Changes Between Census 2000 and the 2010 Census.,"A person's racial or ethnic self-identification can change over time and across contexts, which is a component of population change not usually considered in studies that use race and ethnicity as variables. To facilitate incorporation of this aspect of population change, we show patterns and directions of individual-level race and Hispanic response change throughout the United States and among all federally recognized race/ethnic groups. We use internal U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2000 and 2010 censuses in which responses have been linked at the individual level (N = 162 million). Approximately 9.8 million people (6.1 %) in our data have a different race and/or Hispanic-origin response in 2010 than they did in 2000. Race response change was especially common among those reported as American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Other Pacific Islander, in a multiple-race response group, or Hispanic. People reported as non-Hispanic white, black, or Asian in 2000 usually had the same response in 2010 (3 %, 6 %, and 9 % of responses changed, respectively). Hispanic/non-Hispanic ethnicity responses were also usually consistent (13 % and 1 %, respectively, changed). We found a variety of response change patterns, which we detail. In many race/Hispanic response groups, we see population churn in the form of large countervailing flows of response changes that are hidden in cross-sectional data. We find that response changes happen across ages, sexes, regions, and response modes, with interesting variation across racial/ethnic categories.

"Patterns of Gender Development Across Intersections of Age, Gender, and Ethnicity-Race.","Two components of gender identity are gender similarity, how one's self-concept relates to the major gender collectives (i.e., female, male), and felt pressure to conform to gender norms. The development of these components across ages and contexts has been understudied. The focus of this study was to examine variations in gender similarity and felt pressure across multiple intersecting contexts: developmental stage, gender, and ethnic-racial group. Six data sets were harmonized and means were compared across 2628 participants (51% girls, 49% boys) from four different developmental cohorts (childhood n = 678, early adolescence n = 1322, adolescence n = 415, and young adulthood n = 213) from diverse ethnic-racial backgrounds (45% White, 23% Latinx/Hispanic, 11% Black/African-American, 7% Asian-American, 5% American Indian, and 5% Multiracial). Results revealed nuanced patterns: Gender intensification was supported in early adolescence, primarily for boys. Young adult men reported lower levels of pressure and gender typicality than younger boys, but young adult women's levels were generally not different than younger girls. Surprisingly, young adult women's levels of own-gender similarity and pressure from parents were higher than adolescent girls. Expectations of gender differences in gender typicality and felt pressure were supported for all ages except young adults, with higher levels for boys. Finally, there were more similarities than differences across ethnic-racial groups, though when there were differences, minoritized participants reported heightened gender typicality and pressure (largely accounted for by higher scores for Black and Latinx participants and lower scores for White and Multiracial participants).

Race/ethnic variations in school-year versus summer differences in adolescent physical activity.,"Children and adolescents gain more weight in the summer than the school year, and there are race/ethnic differences in this pattern. Youth physical activity is lower in the summer, and the main aim of the present study was to examine race/ethnic and sex differences in adolescent physical activity, sedentary behavior, and related variables, comparing the school-year and summer. Adolescents aged 11-17 years were recruited from lower-income areas of five states in 2017-2018, and n = 207 completed surveys in both the school-year and summer: 56 African Americans, 30 American Indians, 21 Asian/Pacific Islanders, 49 Latinos, and 51 White, non-Hispanics. Of these, n = 150 also had accelerometer data. Objectively-measured physical activity was lower in the summer, especially among American Indian, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Latino subgroups. Reported screen time was substantially higher in the summer (p < .04), with the biggest increase among African Americans. Reported enjoyment of physical activity was generally lower in the summer (p < .02), which could help explain reduced physical activity. Which race/ethnic groups were at higher risk in the summer varied for physical activity and screen time, so interventions should be tailored for each group. Improved strategies to increase physical activity in the summer, especially among higher-risk groups, could contribute to youth obesity control.",Preventive medicine,"[""child"", ""adolescent"", ""gain"", ""weight"", ""summer"", ""school"", ""year"", ""race"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""pattern"", ""youth"", ""physical"", ""activity"", ""low"", ""summer"", ""main"", ""aim"", ""present"", ""examine"", ""race"", ""ethnic"", ""sex"", ""difference"", ""adolescent"", ""physical"", ""activity"", ""sedentary"", ""behavior"", ""related"", ""variable"", ""compare"", ""school"", ""year"", ""summer"", ""adolescent"", ""aged"", ""11"", ""17"", ""year"", ""recruit"", ""low"", ""income"", ""area"", ""five"", ""state"", ""2017"", ""2018"", ""n"", ""207"", ""complete"", ""survey"", ""school"", ""year"", ""summer"", ""56"", ""african"", ""american"", ""30"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""21"", ""asian"", ""pacific"", ""islander"", ""49"", ""latinos"", ""51"", ""white"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""n"", ""150"", ""also"", ""accelerometer"", ""datum"", ""objectively"", ""measure"", ""physical"", ""activity"", ""low"", ""summer"", ""especially"", ""among"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""asian"", ""pacific"", ""islander"", ""latino"", ""subgroup"", ""report"", ""screen"", ""time"", ""substantially"", ""high"", ""summer"", ""p"", ""04"", ""big"", ""increase"", ""among"", ""african"", ""american"", ""report"", ""enjoyment"", ""physical"", ""activity"", ""generally"", ""low"", ""summer"", ""p"", ""02"", ""could"", ""help"", ""explain"", ""reduce"", ""physical"", ""activity"", ""race"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""high"", ""risk"", ""summer"", ""vary"", ""physical"", ""activity"", ""screen"", ""time"", ""intervention"", ""tailor"", ""group"", ""improved"", ""strategy"", ""increase"", ""physical"", ""activity"", ""summer"", ""especially"", ""among"", ""high"", ""risk"", ""group"", ""could"", ""contribute"", ""youth"", ""obesity""]",None,None,None,"Latino, Asian, Hispanic"
Intersecting Social Inequalities and Body Mass Index Trajectories from Adolescence to Early Adulthood.,"This study combines multiple-hierarchy stratification and life course perspectives to address two research questions critical to understanding U.S. young adult health. First, to what extent are racial-ethnic inequalities in body mass index (BMI) gendered and/or classed? Second, do racial-ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic inequalities in BMI widen or persist between adolescence and early adulthood? Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 cohort and growth curve models, results suggest that among white, black, and Hispanic American men and women ages 13 to 31, racial-ethnic inequality in BMI is greatest among women. Black women experience the highest adolescent BMI and the greatest increases in BMI with age. Furthermore, socioeconomic resources are less protective against weight gain for blacks and Hispanics, with the nature of these relationships varying by gender.

Survey data from the 2007 Los Angeles Mommy and Baby (LAMB) study (N = 4,075) were used to identify predictors and barriers to postpartum care use. The LAMB study was a cross-sectional, population-based study that examined maternal and child health outcomes during the preconception, prenatal, and postpartum periods. Multivariable analyses identified low income, being separated/divorced and never married, trying hard to get pregnant or trying to prevent pregnancy, Medi-Cal insurance holders, and lack of prenatal care to be risk factors of postpartum care nonuse, while Hispanic ethnicity was protective. The most commonly reported barriers to postpartum care use were feeling fine, being too busy with the baby, having other things going on, and a lack of need. Findings from this study can inform the development of interventions targeting subgroups at risk for not obtaining postpartum care.

Socioeconomic and psychosocial mechanisms underlying racial/ethnic disparities in cognition among older adults.,"<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive aging are only partly attributable to socioeconomic indicators. Psychosocial factors, such as discrimination and perceived control, also differ across racial/ethnic groups, and emerging literature highlights their potential role in contributing to cognitive disparities in addition to socioeconomic status. <b><i>Method:</i></b> 1,463 older adults (51% Hispanic, 27% non-Hispanic Black, and 22% non-Hispanic White) in the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project completed cognitive and psychosocial measures, including a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, Everyday and Major Experiences of Lifetime Discrimination scales, and the Perceived Control scale. Mediation models quantified separate indirect effects of Black race and Hispanic ethnicity on global cognitive composite scores through education, income, discrimination, and external perceived control. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Educational attainment, income, and perceived control each mediated racial/ethnic disparities in global cognition. Socioeconomic indicators (i.e., lower education and lower income) explained approximately 50% of the Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities in global cognition, and more external perceived control explained an additional 5%-8%. Hispanics reported the lowest levels of discrimination, while non-Hispanic Blacks reported the highest levels. However, neither everyday nor major lifetime discrimination was associated with global cognition. Significant racial/ethnic disparities in global cognition remained after accounting for the included socioeconomic and psychosocial factors. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> This study suggests that psychosocial factors may explain racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive aging above and beyond socioeconomic indicators. More external perceived control, which could reflect chronic exposure to interpersonal and institutional marginalization, may be a particularly salient psychosocial risk factor for poorer cognitive aging among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic older adults.

Pharmaceutical Side Effects and Mental Health Paradoxes among Racial-Ethnic Minorities.,"Sociologists have long struggled to explain the minority mental health paradox: that racial-ethnic minorities often report better mental health than non-Hispanic whites despite social environments that seem less conducive to well-being. Using data from the 2008-2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), this study provides a partial explanation for the paradox rooted in a very different disparity. Evidence from MEPS indicates that non-Hispanic whites consume more pharmaceuticals than racial-ethnic minorities for a wide variety of medical conditions. Moreover, non-Hispanic whites consume more pharmaceuticals that although effective in treating their focal indication, include depression or suicide as a side effect. In models that adjust for the use of such medications, the minority advantage in significant distress is reduced, in some instances to statistical nonsignificance. Although a significant black and Hispanic advantage in a continuous measure of distress remains, the magnitude of the difference is reduced considerably. The relationship between the use of medications with suicide as a side effect and significant distress is especially large, exceeding, for instance, the relationship between poverty and significant distress. For some minority groups, the less frequent use of such medications is driven by better health (as in the case of Asians), whereas for others, it reflects a treatment disparity (as in the case of blacks), although the consequences for the mental health paradox are the same. The implications of the results are discussed, especially with respect to the neglect of psychological side effects in the treatment of physical disease as well as the problem of multiple morbidities.",Journal of health and social behavior,"[""sociologist"", ""long"", ""struggle"", ""explain"", ""minority"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""paradox"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""often"", ""report"", ""well"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""despite"", ""social"", ""environment"", ""seem"", ""less"", ""conducive"", ""well"", ""use"", ""datum"", ""2008"", ""2013"", ""medical"", ""expenditure"", ""panel"", ""survey"", ""mep"", ""provide"", ""partial"", ""explanation"", ""paradox"", ""root"", ""different"", ""disparity"", ""evidence"", ""mep"", ""indicate"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""consume"", ""pharmaceutical"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""wide"", ""variety"", ""medical"", ""condition"", ""moreover"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""consume"", ""pharmaceutical"", ""although"", ""effective"", ""treat"", ""focal"", ""indication"", ""include"", ""depression"", ""suicide"", ""side"", ""effect"", ""model"", ""adjust"", ""use"", ""medication"", ""minority"", ""advantage"", ""distress"", ""reduce"", ""instance"", ""statistical"", ""nonsignificance"", ""although"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""advantage"", ""continuous"", ""measure"", ""distress"", ""remain"", ""magnitude"", ""difference"", ""reduce"", ""considerably"", ""relationship"", ""use"", ""medication"", ""suicide"", ""side"", ""effect"", ""distress"", ""especially"", ""large"", ""exceed"", ""instance"", ""relationship"", ""poverty"", ""distress"", ""minority"", ""group"", ""less"", ""frequent"", ""use"", ""medication"", ""drive"", ""well"", ""health"", ""case"", ""asian"", ""whereas"", ""other"", ""reflect"", ""treatment"", ""disparity"", ""case"", ""black"", ""although"", ""consequence"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""paradox"", ""implication"", ""discuss"", ""especially"", ""respect"", ""neglect"", ""psychological"", ""side"", ""effect"", ""treatment"", ""physical"", ""disease"", ""well"", ""problem"", ""multiple"", ""morbidity""]","depression, suicide",None,poverty,"Asian, Hispanic"

The Role of Ethnic-Racial Identity and Self-Esteem in Intergroup Contact Attitudes.,"Adolescents' ethnic-racial identity (ERI) exploration, resolution, and affirmation inform their approach and avoidance attitudes toward intergroup contact, but the potential mechanisms through which this occurs have been underexplored. Given the evidence that adolescents with higher ERI exploration, resolution, and affirmation also report higher self-esteem, and self-esteem is theorized to facilitate openness to intergroup contact, the current study explored the role of self-esteem as a mediator of the relation between adolescents' ERI and their intergroup contact attitudes. Participants were 4606 adolescents (M<sub>age</sub> = 16.35, SD = 1.16; 37.5% White, 27.1% Black, 20.7% Latinx, 11.7% Asian American, 3% Native American) from the U.S. Southwest and Midwest. The three waves of data were collected between March 2017 and March 2018. Results from longitudinal multigroup path models indicated that across all ethnic-racial groups there were positive direct relations between Wave 1 (W1) ERI resolution and W2 self-esteem (7 months later). In turn, W2 self-esteem was positively related to W3 approach attitudes (12 months later) and negatively related to W3 avoidance attitudes. The relations between ERI resolution and both approach and avoidance attitudes were fully mediated by self-esteem across all ethnic-racial groups. Notably the baseline values (W1) of all mediation and outcome variables (W2, W3) were included, suggesting that ERI resolution at baseline predicted increases in self-esteem, which predicted subsequent increases in approach attitudes and decreases in avoidance attitudes. ERI exploration and affirmation were not significant predictors of later self-esteem or contact attitudes. These findings suggest that of the three dimensions of ERI examined, resolution is the primary driver of the increases in self-esteem that inform adolescents' attitudes towards interaction with ethnic-racial outgroup members.",Journal of youth and adolescence,"[""adolescent"", ""ethnic"", ""racial"", ""identity"", ""eri"", ""exploration"", ""resolution"", ""affirmation"", ""inform"", ""approach"", ""avoidance"", ""attitude"", ""toward"", ""intergroup"", ""contact"", ""potential"", ""mechanism"", ""occur"", ""underexplored"", ""give"", ""evidence"", ""adolescent"", ""high"", ""eri"", ""exploration"", ""resolution"", ""affirmation"", ""also"", ""report"", ""high"", ""self"", ""esteem"", ""self"", ""esteem"", ""theorize"", ""facilitate"", ""openness"", ""intergroup"", ""contact"", ""current"", ""explore"", ""role"", ""self"", ""esteem"", ""mediator"", ""relation"", ""adolescent"", ""eri"", ""intergroup"", ""contact"", ""attitude"", ""participant"", ""4606"", ""adolescent"", ""sub"", ""age"", ""sub"", ""16"", ""35"", ""sd"", ""1"", ""16"", ""37"", ""5"", ""white"", ""27"", ""1"", ""black"", ""20"", ""7"", ""latinx"", ""11"", ""7"", ""asian"", ""american"", ""3"", ""native"", ""american"", ""u"", ""southwest"", ""midwest"", ""three"", ""wave"", ""datum"", ""collect"", ""march"", ""2017"", ""march"", ""2018"", ""longitudinal"", ""multigroup"", ""path"", ""model"", ""indicate"", ""across"", ""ethnic"", ""racial"", ""group"", ""positive"", ""direct"", ""relation"", ""wave"", ""1"", ""w1"", ""eri"", ""resolution"", ""w2"", ""self"", ""esteem"", ""7"", ""month"", ""later"", ""turn"", ""w2"", ""self"", ""esteem"", ""positively"", ""related"", ""w3"", ""approach"", ""attitude"", ""12"", ""month"", ""later"", ""negatively"", ""related"", ""w3"", ""avoidance"", ""attitude"", ""relation"", ""eri"", ""resolution"", ""approach"", ""avoidance"", ""attitude"", ""fully"", ""mediate"", ""self"", ""esteem"", ""across"", ""ethnic"", ""racial"", ""group"", ""notably"", ""baseline"", ""value"", ""w1"", ""mediation"", ""outcome"", ""variable"", ""w2"", ""w3"", ""include"", ""suggest"", ""eri"", ""resolution"", ""baseline"", ""predict"", ""increase"", ""self"", ""esteem"", ""predict"", ""subsequent"", ""increase"", ""approach"", ""attitude"", ""decrease"", ""avoidance"", ""attitude"", ""eri"", ""exploration"", ""affirmation"", ""predictor"", ""later"", ""self"", ""esteem"", ""contact"", ""attitude"", ""finding"", ""suggest"", ""three"", ""dimension"", ""eri"", ""examine"", ""resolution"", ""primary"", ""driver"", ""increase"", ""self"", ""esteem"", ""inform"", ""adolescent"", ""attitude"", ""towards"", ""interaction"", ""ethnic"", ""racial"", ""outgroup"", ""member""]",None,None,None,"Black, Asian, Native American"

Social and anthropometric factors explaining racial/ethnical differences in birth weight in the United States.,"Though disparities in birth weight by race/ethnicity have been extensively reported in the United States, few studies have systematically investigated factors attributing to its variability. For 10,638,415 singleton infants born during 2009-2012 in the United States, we examined birth weight differences among 14 races and ethnicities (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, American Indian, Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Hawaiian, Guamanian, Mexican, Puerto Rican and Cuban), after sequentially adjusting for maternal, socio-economic and behavioral factors. Average birthweight of non-Hispanic white infants was 3381 g, while for other races/ethnicities birth weight ranged from being 289 g smaller in Japanese to 126 g larger in Samoan infants. Factors explaining differences of more than 50 grams in birth weight compared to white infants were: gestational age for black infants, height and body mass index for all Asian and Samoan mothers, and gestational weight gain for Japanese mothers. Difference in maternal age, parity, socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics did not account for significant portion of birthweight variations for any race.

However, traditional measures of SES may not accurately represent individual financial circumstances among non-Latinx Black and Latinx older adults due to longstanding structural inequities.

Latinx participants reported the lowest SES and greatest financial worry, while Black participants evidenced the most WMHs. Greater financial worry was associated with higher WMHs volume above and beyond education and income, which were not associated with WMHs.

Ethnicity moderates the influence of perceived social status on subjective sleep quality.,"It has long been recognized that socioeconomic status (SES) influences health and health-related behaviors, and it has been suggested that the adverse impact of low SES on health may be partly mediated by poor sleep quality. The relation between sleep and objective and subjective measures of SES has only been explored in a preliminary manner, providing indirect evidence that associations between SES and health might be explained, in part, by disrupted sleep. However, it remains unclear whether low SES directly affects sleep quality or whether the SES-sleep quality relation varies as a function of ethnicity given robust ethnic disparities across SES-related factors. This study examined the relation between perceived social status (i.e., individuals' perception of their socioeconomic standing) and subjective sleep quality among 149 college students, and examined the moderating effect of ethnicity to determine whether the magnitude or direction of association differed among Caucasian, Asian, and African Americans. Using hierarchical regressions and a dummy-coded ethnicity variable, results demonstrated significant moderation (ΔR₂ = 0.04, p = .02), such that both Asian (p = .04) and African Americans (p = .02) were significantly different from Caucasian Americans. Lower perceived social status was related to greater impairment in sleep quality for Asian Americans (β = -.37, p < .01) and African Americans (β = -.51, p < .01), but not Caucasian Americans (β = -.02, p = .87).

Trajectories of posttraumatic stress among urban residents.,"Urban residents experience a wide range of traumatic events and are at increased risk of assaultive violence. Although previous research has examined trajectories of posttraumatic stress (PTS) through latent class growth analysis (LCGA) among persons exposed to the same index events (e.g., a natural disaster), PTS trajectories have not been documented among urban residents. The aims of this study were to conduct LGCA with a sample of trauma survivors from Detroit, Michigan (N = 981), and to explore predictors of trajectory membership. Participants completed three annual telephone surveys, each of which included the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist-Civilian Version. Four PTS trajectories were detected. Although the majority evidenced a trajectory of consistently few symptoms (Low: 72.5%), 4.6% were in a trajectory of chronic severe PTSD (High), and the remainder were in trajectories of consistently elevated, but generally subclinical, levels of PTS (Decreasing: 12.3%; Increasing: 10.6%). Socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., lower income), more extensive trauma history (e.g., childhood abuse), and fewer social resources (e.g., lower social support) were associated with membership in higher PTS trajectories, relative to the Low trajectory. The results suggest that efforts to reduce PTS in urban areas need to attend to socioeconomic vulnerabilities in addition to trauma history and risk for ongoing trauma exposure.",American journal of community psychology,"[""urban"", ""resident"", ""experience"", ""wide"", ""range"", ""traumatic"", ""event"", ""increase"", ""risk"", ""assaultive"", ""violence"", ""although"", ""previous"", ""research"", ""examine"", ""trajectory"", ""posttraumatic"", ""stress"", ""pt"", ""latent"", ""class"", ""growth"", ""analysis"", ""lcga"", ""among"", ""person"", ""expose"", ""index"", ""event"", ""e"", ""g"", ""natural"", ""disaster"", ""pts"", ""trajectory"", ""document"", ""among"", ""urban"", ""resident"", ""aim"", ""conduct"", ""lgca"", ""sample"", ""trauma"", ""survivor"", ""detroit"", ""michigan"", ""n"", ""981"", ""explore"", ""predictor"", ""trajectory"", ""membership"", ""participant"", ""complete"", ""three"", ""annual"", ""telephone"", ""survey"", ""include"", ""posttraumatic"", ""stress"", ""disorder"", ""ptsd"", ""checklist"", ""civilian"", ""version"", ""four"", ""pts"", ""trajectory"", ""detect"", ""although"", ""majority"", ""evidenced"", ""trajectory"", ""consistently"", ""symptom"", ""low"", ""72"", ""5"", ""4"", ""6"", ""trajectory"", ""chronic"", ""severe"", ""ptsd"", ""high"", ""remainder"", ""trajectory"", ""consistently"", ""elevate"", ""generally"", ""subclinical"", ""level"", ""pt"", ""decrease"", ""12"", ""3"", ""increase"", ""10"", ""6"", ""socioeconomic"", ""disadvantage"", ""e"", ""g"", ""low"", ""income"", ""extensive"", ""trauma"", ""history"", ""e"", ""g"", ""childhood"", ""abuse"", ""few"", ""social"", ""resource"", ""e"", ""g"", ""low"", ""social"", ""support"", ""associated"", ""membership"", ""high"", ""pts"", ""trajectory"", ""relative"", ""low"", ""trajectory"", ""suggest"", ""effort"", ""reduce"", ""pts"", ""urban"", ""area"", ""need"", ""attend"", ""socioeconomic"", ""vulnerability"", ""addition"", ""trauma"", ""history"", ""risk"", ""ongoing"", ""trauma"", ""exposure""]",PTSD,None,None,None
Multi-group data versus dual-side theory: On race contrasts and police-caused homicides.,"Empirical evidence points to a persistent Black-White racial gap in police-caused homicides. Some scholarship treats the gap as denoting criminal justice exposure either in terms of involvement in crime or living in a high-crime context. By contrast, health scholarship typically points to the importance of racism including the attitudes, institutional practices, and overall structures that operate to privilege one group over another. Still, given the demographics of US society, the Black-White racial contrast overlooks the 25% of Americans who are neither Black nor White: Native Americans, Latinos, and Asians. The question of how the groups should be organized vis-a-vis the current Black-White model and theories arises. An answer is not straightforward. There is a rank-ordering to the groups' mortality rates as well as an exponential increase in the number of possible comparisons. In this paper we systematically review the literature on race and police-caused homicide with a particular focus on studies that attempt to move beyond the Black-White model. We find that studies on race and police-caused homicide either make no comparison between the groups, or, alternatively, use a White-non-White, a Black-non-Black, and/or a Black-Native American-Latino vs. White-Asian comparison. We use data on group-specific mortality rates to examine the strengths and limits of each of these practices. The limits are the selection of counterfactual gaps, the selection of smaller gaps, and/or the omission of larger gaps. To address these limits, we propose that a Black-Native American vs. Latino-White-Asian model best captures the higher and lower mortality rates in police-caused homicide data.",Social science & medicine (1982),"[""empirical"", ""evidence"", ""point"", ""persistent"", ""black"", ""white"", ""racial"", ""gap"", ""police"", ""cause"", ""homicide"", ""scholarship"", ""treat"", ""gap"", ""denote"", ""criminal"", ""justice"", ""exposure"", ""either"", ""term"", ""involvement"", ""crime"", ""live"", ""high"", ""crime"", ""context"", ""contrast"", ""health"", ""scholarship"", ""typically"", ""point"", ""importance"", ""racism"", ""include"", ""attitude"", ""institutional"", ""practice"", ""overall"", ""structure"", ""operate"", ""privilege"", ""one"", ""group"", ""another"", ""still"", ""give"", ""demographic"", ""we"", ""society"", ""black"", ""white"", ""racial"", ""contrast"", ""overlooks"", ""25"", ""american"", ""neither"", ""black"", ""white"", ""native"", ""american"", ""latinos"", ""asian"", ""question"", ""group"", ""organize"", ""vis"", ""vis"", ""current"", ""black"", ""white"", ""model"", ""theory"", ""arise"", ""answer"", ""straightforward"", ""rank"", ""ordering"", ""group"", ""mortality"", ""rate"", ""well"", ""exponential"", ""increase"", ""number"", ""possible"", ""comparison"", ""paper"", ""systematically"", ""review"", ""literature"", ""race"", ""police"", ""cause"", ""homicide"", ""particular"", ""focus"", ""study"", ""attempt"", ""move"", ""beyond"", ""black"", ""white"", ""model"", ""find"", ""study"", ""race"", ""police"", ""cause"", ""homicide"", ""either"", ""make"", ""comparison"", ""group"", ""alternatively"", ""use"", ""white"", ""non"", ""white"", ""black"", ""non"", ""black"", ""black"", ""native"", ""american"", ""latino"", ""vs"", ""white"", ""asian"", ""comparison"", ""use"", ""data"", ""group"", ""specific"", ""mortality"", ""rate"", ""examine"", ""strength"", ""limit"", ""practice"", ""limit"", ""selection"", ""counterfactual"", ""gap"", ""selection"", ""small"", ""gap"", ""omission"", ""large"", ""gap"", ""address"", ""limit"", ""propose"", ""black"", ""native"", ""american"", ""vs"", ""latino"", ""white"", ""asian"", ""model"", ""good"", ""capture"", ""high"", ""low"", ""mortality"", ""rate"", ""police"", ""cause"", ""homicide"", ""datum""]",None,None,None,"Black, Latino, Asian, Native American"

The results of mediated moderation analyses showed that for Asians and Whites, higher academic achievement was associated with more same-ethnic friendships, whereas for Blacks and Latinos, higher academic achievement was associated with more cross-ethnic friendships.

"Racial and Ethnic Patterning of Low Birth Weight, Normal Birth Weight, and Macrosomia.","Both low birthweight (<2500 g; LBW) and macrosomia (>4000 g) are considered adverse birth outcomes and are associated with later poor health conditions, yet the social determinants of macrosomia are understudied. In this study, we explore patterning of LBW, normal birthweight, and macrosomia by race/ethnicity and nativity. We examined data from all live births between 1999 and 2014 in New Jersey with a non-missing, plausible value of birthweight (n = 1,609,516). We compared the risk for LBW and macrosomia among non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Asian mothers, and between the US- and native-born. For Hispanics and Asians, we also examined differences by country of origin. The racial/ethnic patterns for macrosomia mirrored those of LBW, suggesting that the factors underlying LBW shift birthweight distributions. For example, non-Hispanic White mothers had the lowest risk for LBW and the highest risk for macrosomia. Nativity patterns differed by subgroup, however, with unique risks for macrosomia among some origin groups, such as foreign-born Cubans. The racial/ethnic and nativity patterns of macrosomia do not completely mirror those of LBW, suggesting some distinct social risk factors for macrosomia.

Racial Differences in Health Care Transitions and Hospice Use at the End of Life.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Although the fragmentation of end-of-life care has been well documented, previous research has not examined racial and ethnic differences in transitions in care and hospice use at the end of life. <b><i>Design and Subjects:</i></b> Retrospective cohort study among 649,477 Medicare beneficiaries who died between July 2011 and December 2011. <b><i>Measurements:</i></b> Sankey diagrams and heatmaps to visualize the health care transitions across race/ethnic groups. Among hospice enrollees, we examined racial/ethnic differences in hospice use patterns, including length of hospice enrollment and disenrollment rate. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The mean number of care transitions within the last six months of life was 2.9 transitions (standard deviation [SD] = 2.7) for whites, 3.4 transitions (SD = 3.2) for African Americans, 2.8 transitions (SD = 3.0) for Hispanics, and 2.4 transitions (SD = 2.7) for Asian Americans. After adjusting for age and sex, having at least four transitions was significantly more common for African Americans (39.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.8-39.6%) compared with whites (32.5%, 95% CI: 32.3-32.6%), and less common among Hispanics (31.2%, 95% CI: 30.4-32.0%), and Asian Americans (26.5%, 95% CI: 25.5-27.5%). Having no care transition was significantly more common for Asian Americans (33.0%, 95% CI: 32.0-34.1%) and Hispanics (28.8%, 95% CI: 28.0-29.6%), compared with African Americans (19.2%, 95% CI: 18.9-19.5%) and whites (18.9%, 95% CI: 18.8-19.0%).

Menstrual and oral contraceptive use patterns among deployed military women by race and ethnicity.,"Menstrual cycle patterns and concerns and oral contraceptive use in the combat environment were examined in Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic, and African American women to guide the development of educational resources for women soldiers. An anonymous, questionnaire was completed by 455 U.S. Army women-Caucasian (CA: n = 141); Asian (AS: n = 67); Hispanic (HIS: n = 67); and African American (AA: n = 184) to compare menstrual patterns and concerns, dysmenorrhea, and oral contraceptive patterns. Total menstrual concerns were significantly lower among African Americans relative to Caucasians, Asians, or Hispanics; Asians and Hispanics reported the greatest concern. Overall, secondary amenorrhea was noted by 14.9% of women. Severe dysmenorrhea rates were significantly lower in African American (6.1%) compared to Caucasian (11.6%), Asian (20.9%) and Hispanic (19.7%) women. Asian women reported missing less work-only 9.3% with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea missed work compared to 25.1% of all other women. Only 9.2% of women with mild, compared to 25.8% with moderate to severe (OR = 3.44; p ≤ 0.0001) dysmenorrhea sought health care. Less than 50% of women took oral contraceptive, and less than half of those women took oral contraceptive continuously.

A Person-Centered Analysis of Adolescent Multicultural Socialization Niches and Academic Functioning.,"Despite the growing cultural diversity worldwide, there is scarce research on how socialization processes prepare youth to respond to increasing multicultural demands and the degree to which these socialization opportunities inform youth academic functioning. This study used a person-centered approach to identify profiles or niches based on the degree and consistency of multicultural socialization experiences across school, peer, and family settings and to examine the associations between identified niches and markers of academic functioning (i.e., emotional and behavioral academic engagement, academic aspirations and expectations) in a sample of adolescents (N = 717; M<sub>age</sub> = 13.73 years). Participants (49.9% girls) were from the U.S. Southwest and represented multiple ethno-racial backgrounds (31.8% Hispanic/Latinx, 31.5% Multiethnic, 25.7% White, 7.3% Black or African American, 1.4% Asian American or Pacific Islander, 1.4% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 1% Arab, Middle Eastern, or North African). Six distinct multicultural socialization niches were identified. Three niches had similar patterns across school-peer-family but ranged in the degree of socialization. The cross-setting similar higher socialization niche (Niche 6) demonstrated greater socialization than the cross-setting similar moderate (Niche 5) and lower socialization (Niche 4) niches, which had moderate and lower socialization, respectively. Three niches demonstrated cross-setting dissimilarity which ranged in the type of cross-setting contrast and the degree of socialization. The cross-setting dissimilar school contrast socialization niche (Niche 3) had greater dissimilarities between socialization opportunities in the school setting compared to the peer and family settings and demonstrated the lowest levels of socialization of all niches. The other two niches, the cross-setting dissimilar peer contrast (Niche 1) and greater peer contrast socialization (Niche 2) niches had larger dissimilarities between socialization opportunities in the peer setting than the school and family settings. In the former, however, the contrast was lower, and socialization ranged between very low to low. In the latter, the contrast was higher and socialization ranged from very low to moderate. Most adolescents were in the cross-setting similar lower socialization niche or in the cross-setting dissimilar niches. Adolescents in the cross-setting similar higher multicultural socialization demonstrated greater emotional and behavioral academic engagement than adolescents in most of the other niches. Adolescents in the cross-setting dissimilar school contrast niches demonstrated lower emotional and behavioral academic engagement and lower academic expectations than adolescents in some of the other niches. The results emphasize the collective role of school, peer, and family multicultural socialization on emotional and behavioral academic engagement.",Journal of youth and adolescence,"[""despite"", ""grow"", ""cultural"", ""diversity"", ""worldwide"", ""scarce"", ""research"", ""socialization"", ""process"", ""prepare"", ""youth"", ""respond"", ""increase"", ""multicultural"", ""demand"", ""degree"", ""socialization"", ""opportunity"", ""inform"", ""youth"", ""academic"", ""function"", ""used"", ""person"", ""centered"", ""approach"", ""identify"", ""profile"", ""niche"", ""base"", ""degree"", ""consistency"", ""multicultural"", ""socialization"", ""experience"", ""across"", ""school"", ""peer"", ""family"", ""setting"", ""examine"", ""association"", ""identify"", ""niche"", ""marker"", ""academic"", ""function"", ""e"", ""emotional"", ""behavioral"", ""academic"", ""engagement"", ""academic"", ""aspiration"", ""expectation"", ""sample"", ""adolescent"", ""n"", ""717"", ""sub"", ""age"", ""sub"", ""13"", ""73"", ""year"", ""participant"", ""49"", ""9"", ""girl"", ""u"", ""southwest"", ""represent"", ""multiple"", ""ethno"", ""racial"", ""background"", ""31"", ""8"", ""hispanic"", ""latinx"", ""31"", ""5"", ""multiethnic"", ""25"", ""7"", ""white"", ""7"", ""3"", ""black"", ""african"", ""american"", ""1"", ""4"", ""asian"", ""american"", ""pacific"", ""islander"", ""1"", ""4"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""alaska"", ""native"", ""1"", ""arab"", ""middle"", ""eastern"", ""north"", ""african"", ""six"", ""distinct"", ""multicultural"", ""socialization"", ""niche"", ""identify"", ""three"", ""niche"", ""similar"", ""pattern"", ""across"", ""school"", ""peer"", ""family"", ""range"", ""degree"", ""socialization"", ""cross"", ""set"", ""similar"", ""high"", ""socialization"", ""niche"", ""niche"", ""6"", ""demonstrate"", ""great"", ""socialization"", ""cross"", ""set"", ""similar"", ""moderate"", ""niche"", ""5"", ""low"", ""socialization"", ""niche"", ""4"", ""niche"", ""moderate"", ""low"", ""socialization"", ""respectively"", ""three"", ""niche"", ""demonstrate"", ""cross"", ""setting"", ""dissimilarity"", ""range"", ""type"", ""cross"", ""setting"", ""contrast"", ""degree"", ""socialization"", ""cross"", ""set"", ""dissimilar"", ""school"", ""contrast"", ""socialization"", ""niche"", ""niche"", ""3"", ""great"", ""dissimilarity"", ""socialization"", ""opportunity"", ""school"", ""setting"", ""compare"", ""peer"", ""family"", ""setting"", ""demonstrate"", ""low"", ""level"", ""socialization"", ""niche"", ""two"", ""niche"", ""cross"", ""set"", ""dissimilar"", ""peer"", ""contrast"", ""niche"", ""1"", ""great"", ""peer"", ""contrast"", ""socialization"", ""niche"", ""2"", ""niche"", ""large"", ""dissimilarity"", ""socialization"", ""opportunity"", ""peer"", ""set"", ""school"", ""family"", ""setting"", ""former"", ""however"", ""contrast"", ""low"", ""socialization"", ""range"", ""low"", ""low"", ""latter"", ""contrast"", ""high"", ""socialization"", ""range"", ""low"", ""moderate"", ""adolescent"", ""cross"", ""set"", ""similar"", ""low"", ""socialization"", ""niche"", ""cross"", ""set"", ""dissimilar"", ""niche"", ""adolescent"", ""cross"", ""set"", ""similar"", ""high"", ""multicultural"", ""socialization"", ""demonstrate"", ""great"", ""emotional"", ""behavioral"", ""academic"", ""engagement"", ""adolescent"", ""niche"", ""adolescent"", ""cross"", ""set"", ""dissimilar"", ""school"", ""contrast"", ""niche"", ""demonstrate"", ""low"", ""emotional"", ""behavioral"", ""academic"", ""engagement"", ""low"", ""academic"", ""expectation"", ""adolescent"", ""niche"", ""emphasize"", ""collective"", ""role"", ""school"", ""peer"", ""family"", ""multicultural"", ""socialization"", ""emotional"", ""behavioral"", ""academic"", ""engagement""]",None,None,None,"Black, Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern"
Implementation of differential response: a racial equity analysis.,"Differential response is a growing approach in child welfare that allows for a more flexible response to keep children safe by better engaging families. This study examined the implementation of Minnesota's approach called Family Assessment response, and explored the impact on racial equity outcomes in the state's child welfare system. Using logistic regression to analyze administrative child welfare data for all screened-in cases between 2003 and 2010 (n=122,095), this study explored whether race was a predictor in the following decision points: (1) pathway assignment to either Family Assessment (FA) response or a traditional investigation (TI); and (2) switching pathway assignment from FA to TI. Findings of the analysis indicated that when controlling for poverty and other risk factors, African American, Native American and Multiracial children were less likely to be assigned to FA compared to Caucasian children for some, but not all years in the study timeframe; while Hispanic children were more likely to be assigned to FA compared to non-Hispanic children for several years in the study timeframe. Disparities around pathway switch from family assessment to traditional investigation completely diminished over time. The results of this study highlight the importance of applying a racial equity lens in examining new policies and practices to ensure equitable implementation for all children and families. The findings also emphasize the need for better understanding of the unique experiences of Native American and Multiracial children and families, who have been under-represented in the research on racial disparities in child welfare.",Child abuse & neglect,"[""differential"", ""response"", ""grow"", ""approach"", ""child"", ""welfare"", ""allow"", ""flexible"", ""response"", ""keep"", ""child"", ""safe"", ""well"", ""engage"", ""family"", ""examine"", ""implementation"", ""minnesota"", ""approach"", ""call"", ""family"", ""assessment"", ""response"", ""explore"", ""impact"", ""racial"", ""equity"", ""outcome"", ""state"", ""child"", ""welfare"", ""system"", ""use"", ""logistic"", ""regression"", ""analyze"", ""administrative"", ""child"", ""welfare"", ""datum"", ""screen"", ""case"", ""2003"", ""2010"", ""n"", ""122"", ""095"", ""explore"", ""whether"", ""race"", ""predictor"", ""follow"", ""decision"", ""point"", ""1"", ""pathway"", ""assignment"", ""either"", ""family"", ""assessment"", ""fa"", ""response"", ""traditional"", ""investigation"", ""ti"", ""2"", ""switching"", ""pathway"", ""assignment"", ""fa"", ""ti"", ""finding"", ""analysis"", ""indicate"", ""control"", ""poverty"", ""risk"", ""factor"", ""african"", ""american"", ""native"", ""american"", ""multiracial"", ""child"", ""less"", ""likely"", ""assign"", ""fa"", ""compare"", ""caucasian"", ""child"", ""year"", ""timeframe"", ""hispanic"", ""child"", ""likely"", ""assign"", ""fa"", ""compare"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""child"", ""several"", ""year"", ""timeframe"", ""disparity"", ""around"", ""pathway"", ""switch"", ""family"", ""assessment"", ""traditional"", ""investigation"", ""completely"", ""diminish"", ""time"", ""highlight"", ""importance"", ""apply"", ""racial"", ""equity"", ""lens"", ""examine"", ""new"", ""policy"", ""practice"", ""ensure"", ""equitable"", ""implementation"", ""child"", ""family"", ""finding"", ""also"", ""emphasize"", ""need"", ""well"", ""understand"", ""unique"", ""experience"", ""native"", ""american"", ""multiracial"", ""child"", ""family"", ""represent"", ""research"", ""racial"", ""disparity"", ""child"", ""welfare""]",None,aging,poverty,"Caucasian, Native American, Hispanic"

The analysis presented here uses data from the National Survey of America's Families to examine changes in health insurance coverage and respondent-reported health status by race and ethnicity. The data indicate that public coverage increased for black, Hispanic and white children between 1997 and 2002. Uninsurance rates fell among children in low-income black, Hispanic and white families, remained constant among black and white children in higher-income families, and increased among higher-income Hispanic children. The health status of children was stable for blacks, Hispanics and whites except for a decline in health among higher-income Hispanic children. Black and white adults saw increases in public health insurance coverage but not in overall coverage. The uninsurance rate of Hispanic adults increased, despite expanded public coverage of higher-income Hispanic adults. None of these developments altered racial and ethnic disparities in health.

Subjective Social Status and Financial Hardship: Associations of Alternative Indicators of Socioeconomic Status with Problem Drinking in Asian Americans and Latinos.,"<i>Background:</i> Prior research shows inconsistent associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and alcohol outcomes, particularly for immigrant populations. Conventional markers of SES may not fully capture how social position affects health in these groups. <i>Objective:</i> We examine: (1) the associations of two alternative indicators, subjective social status (SSS) and financial hardship, with problem drinking outcomes, heavy episodic drinking (HED) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), for Asian Americans and Latinos; and (2) moderation of these relationships by educational level and nativity status. <i>Methods:</i> Multiple logistic regression modeling was performed using nationally-representative Asian American (<i>n</i> = 2,095) and Latino samples (<i>n</i> = 2,554) from the National Latino and Asian American Study. Age, gender, nativity, individual-level SES (income and education), unfair treatment, racial discrimination, and social support were adjusted. <i>Results:</i> Financial hardship was independently associated with AUD in both Asians and Latinos. Lower SSS was associated with increased AUD risk among individuals with college degrees or with US nativity in both populations. The association between financial hardship and HED was positive for US-born Latinos and foreign-born Asians, and negative for foreign-born Latinos. <i>Conclusions:</i> SSS and financial hardship are indicators of SES that may have particular relevance for immigrant health, independently of education and income, with SSS particularly meaningful for AUD in the more conventionally advantaged subgroups. There may be underlying processes affecting Asian and other Latino subgroups with similar socioeconomic and nativity profiles and exposing them to common risk/protective factors of AUD.",Substance use & misuse,"[""background"", ""prior"", ""research"", ""show"", ""inconsistent"", ""association"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""ses"", ""alcohol"", ""outcome"", ""particularly"", ""immigrant"", ""population"", ""conventional"", ""marker"", ""se"", ""may"", ""fully"", ""capture"", ""social"", ""position"", ""affect"", ""health"", ""group"", ""objective"", ""examine"", ""1"", ""association"", ""two"", ""alternative"", ""indicator"", ""subjective"", ""social"", ""status"", ""sss"", ""financial"", ""hardship"", ""problem"", ""drink"", ""outcome"", ""heavy"", ""episodic"", ""drinking"", ""he"", ""d"", ""alcohol"", ""use"", ""disorder"", ""aud"", ""asian"", ""american"", ""latinos"", ""2"", ""moderation"", ""relationship"", ""educational"", ""level"", ""nativity"", ""status"", ""method"", ""multiple"", ""logistic"", ""regression"", ""modeling"", ""perform"", ""use"", ""nationally"", ""representative"", ""asian"", ""american"", ""n"", ""2"", ""095"", ""latino"", ""sample"", ""n"", ""2"", ""554"", ""national"", ""latino"", ""asian"", ""american"", ""age"", ""gender"", ""nativity"", ""individual"", ""level"", ""ses"", ""income"", ""education"", ""unfair"", ""treatment"", ""racial"", ""discrimination"", ""social"", ""support"", ""adjust"", ""financial"", ""hardship"", ""independently"", ""associate"", ""aud"", ""asian"", ""latinos"", ""low"", ""sss"", ""associate"", ""increase"", ""aud"", ""risk"", ""among"", ""individual"", ""college"", ""degree"", ""we"", ""nativity"", ""population"", ""association"", ""financial"", ""hardship"", ""he"", ""d"", ""positive"", ""we"", ""bear"", ""latinos"", ""foreign"", ""bear"", ""asian"", ""negative"", ""foreign"", ""bear"", ""latinos"", ""conclusion"", ""sss"", ""financial"", ""hardship"", ""indicator"", ""se"", ""may"", ""particular"", ""relevance"", ""immigrant"", ""health"", ""independently"", ""education"", ""income"", ""sss"", ""particularly"", ""meaningful"", ""aud"", ""conventionally"", ""advantaged"", ""subgroup"", ""may"", ""underlie"", ""process"", ""affect"", ""asian"", ""latino"", ""subgroup"", ""similar"", ""socioeconomic"", ""nativity"", ""profile"", ""expose"", ""common"", ""risk"", ""protective"", ""factor"", ""aud""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,"Latino, Asian"

Child health in the United States: recent trends in racial/ethnic disparities.,"In the United States, race and ethnicity are considered key social determinants of health because of their enduring association with social and economic opportunities and resources. An important policy and research concern is whether the U.S. is making progress toward reducing racial/ethnic inequalities in health. While race/ethnic disparities in infant and adult outcomes are well documented, less is known about patterns and trends by race/ethnicity among children. Our objective was to determine the patterns of and progress toward reducing racial/ethnic disparities in child health. Using nationally representative data from 1998 to 2009, we assessed 17 indicators of child health, including overall health status, disability, measures of specific illnesses, and indicators of the social and economic consequences of illnesses. We examined disparities across five race/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, and non-Hispanic other). We found important racial/ethnic disparities across nearly all of the indicators of health we examined, adjusting for socioeconomic status, nativity, and access to health care. Importantly, we found little evidence that racial/ethnic disparities in child health have changed over time. In fact, for certain illnesses such as asthma, black-white disparities grew significantly larger over time. In general, black children had the highest reported prevalence across the health indicators and Asian children had the lowest reported prevalence. Hispanic children tended to be more similar to whites compared to the other race/ethnic groups, but there was considerable variability in their relative standing.",Social science & medicine (1982),"[""united"", ""state"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""consider"", ""key"", ""social"", ""determinant"", ""health"", ""enduring"", ""association"", ""social"", ""economic"", ""opportunity"", ""resource"", ""important"", ""policy"", ""research"", ""concern"", ""whether"", ""u"", ""make"", ""progress"", ""toward"", ""reduce"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""inequality"", ""health"", ""race"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""infant"", ""adult"", ""outcome"", ""well"", ""document"", ""less"", ""known"", ""pattern"", ""trend"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""among"", ""child"", ""objective"", ""determine"", ""pattern"", ""progress"", ""toward"", ""reduce"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""child"", ""health"", ""use"", ""nationally"", ""representative"", ""datum"", ""1998"", ""2009"", ""assess"", ""17"", ""indicator"", ""child"", ""health"", ""include"", ""overall"", ""health"", ""status"", ""disability"", ""measure"", ""specific"", ""illness"", ""indicator"", ""social"", ""economic"", ""consequence"", ""illness"", ""examine"", ""disparity"", ""across"", ""five"", ""race"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""find"", ""important"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""across"", ""nearly"", ""indicator"", ""health"", ""examine"", ""adjust"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""nativity"", ""access"", ""health"", ""care"", ""importantly"", ""find"", ""little"", ""evidence"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""child"", ""health"", ""change"", ""time"", ""fact"", ""certain"", ""illness"", ""asthma"", ""black"", ""white"", ""disparity"", ""grow"", ""significantly"", ""large"", ""time"", ""general"", ""black"", ""child"", ""highest"", ""report"", ""prevalence"", ""across"", ""health"", ""indicator"", ""asian"", ""child"", ""lowest"", ""reported"", ""prevalence"", ""hispanic"", ""child"", ""tend"", ""similar"", ""white"", ""compare"", ""race"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""considerable"", ""variability"", ""relative"", ""standing""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,"Asian, Hispanic"

Economic deprivation and early childhood development.,"We consider 3 questions regarding the effects of economic deprivation on child development. First, how are developmental outcomes in childhood affected by poverty and such poverty correlates as single parenthood, ethnicity, and maternal education? Second, what are the developmental consequences of the duration and timing of family economic deprivation? And, third, what is the comparative influence of economic deprivation at the family and neighborhood level? We investigate these issues with longitudinal data from the Infant Health and Development Program. We find that family income and poverty status are powerful correlates of the cognitive development and behavior of children, even after accounting for other differences--in particular family structure and maternal schooling--between low- and high-income families. While the duration of poverty matters, its timing in early childhood does not. Age-5 IQs are found to be higher in neighborhoods with greater concentrations of affluent neighbors, while the prevalence of low-income neighbors appears to increase the incidence of externalizing behavior problems.",Child development,"[""consider"", ""3"", ""question"", ""regard"", ""effect"", ""economic"", ""deprivation"", ""child"", ""development"", ""first"", ""developmental"", ""outcome"", ""childhood"", ""affect"", ""poverty"", ""poverty"", ""correlate"", ""single"", ""parenthood"", ""ethnicity"", ""maternal"", ""education"", ""second"", ""developmental"", ""consequence"", ""duration"", ""timing"", ""family"", ""economic"", ""deprivation"", ""third"", ""comparative"", ""influence"", ""economic"", ""deprivation"", ""family"", ""neighborhood"", ""level"", ""investigate"", ""issue"", ""longitudinal"", ""datum"", ""infant"", ""health"", ""development"", ""program"", ""find"", ""family"", ""income"", ""poverty"", ""status"", ""powerful"", ""correlate"", ""cognitive"", ""development"", ""behavior"", ""child"", ""even"", ""account"", ""difference"", ""particular"", ""family"", ""structure"", ""maternal"", ""school"", ""low"", ""high"", ""income"", ""family"", ""duration"", ""poverty"", ""matter"", ""time"", ""early"", ""childhood"", ""age"", ""5"", ""iqs"", ""find"", ""high"", ""neighborhood"", ""great"", ""concentration"", ""affluent"", ""neighbor"", ""prevalence"", ""low"", ""income"", ""neighbor"", ""appear"", ""increase"", ""incidence"", ""externalizing"", ""behavior"", ""problem""]",None,None,poverty,None

Kin location and racial disparities in exiting and entering poor neighborhoods.,"Blacks and Latinos/as are less likely than Whites to move from a poor neighborhood to a non-poor neighborhood and are more likely to move in the reverse direction. Using individual-level data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1980-2013) and neighborhood-level census data, this study explores the role that the spatial location of familial kin networks plays in explaining these racially and ethnically disparate mobility patterns. Blacks and Latinos/as live closer than Whites to nuclear kin, and they are also more likely than Whites to have kin members living in poor neighborhoods. Close geographic proximity to kin and higher levels of kin neighborhood poverty inhibit moving from a poor to a non-poor neighborhood, and increase the risk of moving from a non-poor to a poor tract.

Black women reported less unfavorable body talk compared to White, Hispanic, and Asian women. Conversely, Black and Hispanic women reported more experience with favorable body talk compared to White women. Asian men reported more experience with favorable and unfavorable body talk compared to White men, and Black men reported more experience with favorable body talk compared to White men. Findings for Black women and men are largely consistent with body image literature espousing personal individualization of beauty and style (e.g., ""She's got it going on"").

Racial and socioeconomic disparities in outcomes following pediatric cerebrospinal fluid shunt procedures.,"OBJECT Racial and socioeconomic disparities within the US health care system are a growing concern. Despite extensive research and efforts to narrow such disparities, minorities and economically disadvantaged patients continue to exhibit inferior health care outcomes. Disparities in the delivery of pediatric neurosurgical care are understudied. Authors of this study examine the impact of race and socioeconomic status on outcomes following pediatric CSF shunting procedures. METHODS Discharge information from the 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009 Kids' Inpatient Database for individuals (age < 21 years) with a diagnosis of hydrocephalus who had undergone CSF shunting procedures was abstracted for analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analyses, adjusting for patient and hospital factors and annual CSF shunt procedure volume, were performed to evaluate the effects of race and payer status on the likelihood of inpatient mortality and nonroutine hospital discharge (that is, not to home). RESULTS African American patients (p < 0.05) had an increased likelihood of inpatient death and nonroutine discharge compared with white patients. Furthermore, Medicaid patients had a significantly higher likelihood of nonroutine discharge (p < 0.05) as compared with privately insured patients.

Racial and ethnic diversity of the U.S. national nurse workforce 1988-2013.,"The objective of this article is to examine the racial and ethnic diversity profile of the nurse workforce over time and by geographic region. We conducted survey analysis using the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses from 1988 to 2008, and further supplemented our trend analysis using published findings from the 2013 National Workforce Survey of Registered Nurses. The gap in racial/ethnic minority representation between the RN workforce and the population has been persistent and has widened over time. This diversity gap is primarily due to underrepresentation of Hispanics and Blacks in the RN workforce, which varied across states and regions, with the largest gaps occurring for Hispanics in the South and West and for Blacks in the South.

Adolescent profiles of ethnicity/race and socioeconomic status: Implications for sleep and the role of discrimination and ethnic/racial identity.,"The present study seeks to explore the intersectionality of ethnicity/race and socioeconomic status (SES) among ethnic/racial minority adolescents in their developmental contexts, examining its implications for sleep disparities and the roles of discrimination and ethnic/racial identity (ERI; i.e., adolescents' understanding and feelings about who they are in relation to their ethnic/racial group). With 350 adolescents (Asian 41.4%, Black, 21.7%, and Latinx 36.9%, female=69.1%, Mage=14.27), we conducted a latent class analysis (LCA) to identify latent classes of adolescents' ethnicity/race, ethnic/racial diversity in their schools and neighborhoods along with SES of their families, schools, and neighborhoods. Next, with hierarchical regression, we tested the association between class membership and subjective and objective sleep duration and quality, followed by the moderating effect of discrimination and ERI. We expected to find adolescents living in low diversity and low SES across various developmental contexts to experience lower levels of subjective and objective sleep duration and quality compared to their counterparts. We also expected to find exacerbating effects of discrimination and ERI exploration, and protective effects of ERI commitment in these associations. Three latent groups were identified (C1: ""Black/Latinx adolescents in low/moderate SES families in varying diversity and low SES schools and neighborhoods,"" C2: ""Predominantly Latinx adolescents in low SES families and moderate diversity and SES schools and neighborhoods,"" and C3: ""Predominantly Asian adolescents in low/moderate SES families in moderate/high diversity and SES schools and neighborhoods""). The class memberships to C1 and C2 were associated with compromised sleep duration and quality compared to C3. An interaction effect of discrimination was found for C1 in subjective sleep duration and for C2 in objective sleep duration.

Racial and ethnic disparities in monthly trends in alcohol-induced mortality among US adults from January 2018 through December 2021.,"<i>Background:</i> Historically, American Indians/Alaska Natives (AIANs), Blacks, and Hispanics have experienced higher alcohol-induced mortality rates. Given a disproportionate surge in unemployment rate and financial strain among racial and ethnic minorities and limited access to alcohol use disorder treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to examine monthly trends in alcohol-induced mortality in the United States during the pandemic.<i>Objectives:</i> This study estimates changes in monthly alcohol-induced mortality among US adults by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.<i>Methods:</i> Using monthly deaths from 2018-2021 national mortality files (<i>N</i> = 178,201 deaths, 71.5% male, 28.5% female) and census-based monthly population estimates, we calculated age-specific monthly alcohol-induced death rates and performed log-linear regression to derive monthly percent increases in mortality rates.<i>Results:</i> Alcohol-induced deaths among adults aged ≥25 years increased by 25.7% between 2019 (38,868 deaths) and 2020 (48,872 deaths). During 2018-2021, the estimated monthly percent change was higher for females (1.1% per month) than males (1.0%), and highest for AIANs (1.4%), followed by Blacks (1.2%), Hispanics (1.0%), non-Hispanic Whites (1.0%), and Asians (0.8%). In particular, between February 2020 and January 2021, alcohol-induced mortality increased by 43% for males, 53% for females, 107% for AIANs, the largest increase, followed by Blacks (58%), Hispanics (56%), Asians (44%), and non-Hispanic Whites (39%).<i>Conclusions:</i> During the peak months of the pandemic, the rising trends in alcohol-induced mortality differed substantially by race and ethnicity.

Data spanning three decades illustrate racial disparities in likelihood of obesity.,"Obesity rates have risen significantly in recent decades, with underprivileged Americans associated with higher rates of the condition. Risks associated with obesity, furthermore, appear unequally distributed across different racial/ethnic groups, according to the literature. The present study examined racial disparities in obesity as a function of socioeconomic factors, using a sample of American adults from a 32-year longitudinal study. We accounted for the time factor as we evaluated obesity's associations with selected socioeconomic factors; we also examined race/ethnicity's moderating role in obesity-socioeconomic status associations over time. We used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to obtain a final sample of 118,749 person-waves for analysis. A subsample of person-waves numbering 65,702 represented data from White respondents; one numbering 31,618 represented data from Black respondents; and one numbering 21,429 represented data from Hispanic respondents. Needing to consider repeated measures of the same variables over time, we chose generalized estimated equations (GEE) for use in the data analysis. Speaking generally, the obtained results suggested that for the two smaller subsamples, minority race/ethnicity could have introduced disadvantages that helped explain links between obesity and race/ethnicity. Results also showed that White-Black disparities in obesity have widened slightly in the past three decades, while White-Hispanic disparities have stabilized during the same time period.",Ethnicity & health,"[""obesity"", ""rate"", ""rise"", ""significantly"", ""recent"", ""decade"", ""underprivileged"", ""american"", ""associate"", ""high"", ""rate"", ""condition"", ""risk"", ""associate"", ""obesity"", ""furthermore"", ""appear"", ""unequally"", ""distribute"", ""across"", ""different"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""accord"", ""literature"", ""present"", ""examine"", ""racial"", ""disparity"", ""obesity"", ""function"", ""socioeconomic"", ""factor"", ""use"", ""sample"", ""american"", ""adult"", ""32"", ""year"", ""longitudinal"", ""account"", ""time"", ""factor"", ""evaluate"", ""obesity"", ""association"", ""select"", ""socioeconomic"", ""factor"", ""also"", ""examine"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""moderating"", ""role"", ""obesity"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""association"", ""time"", ""use"", ""datum"", ""national"", ""longitudinal"", ""survey"", ""youth"", ""nlsy"", ""obtain"", ""final"", ""sample"", ""118"", ""749"", ""person"", ""wave"", ""analysis"", ""subsample"", ""person"", ""wave"", ""number"", ""65"", ""702"", ""represented"", ""datum"", ""white"", ""respondent"", ""one"", ""number"", ""31"", ""618"", ""represent"", ""datum"", ""black"", ""respondent"", ""one"", ""number"", ""21"", ""429"", ""represented"", ""datum"", ""hispanic"", ""respondent"", ""need"", ""consider"", ""repeated"", ""measure"", ""variable"", ""time"", ""choose"", ""generalize"", ""estimate"", ""equation"", ""gee"", ""use"", ""data"", ""analysis"", ""speak"", ""generally"", ""obtain"", ""suggest"", ""two"", ""small"", ""subsample"", ""minority"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""could"", ""introduce"", ""disadvantage"", ""help"", ""explain"", ""link"", ""obesity"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""also"", ""show"", ""white"", ""black"", ""disparity"", ""obesity"", ""widen"", ""slightly"", ""past"", ""three"", ""decade"", ""white"", ""hispanic"", ""disparity"", ""stabilize"", ""time"", ""period""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,"Black, Hispanic"

Charting How Wealth Shapes Educational Pathways from Childhood to Early Adulthood: A Developmental Process Model.,"Wealth plays a pervasive role in sustaining inequality and is more inequitably distributed than household income. Research has identified that wealth contributes to children's educational outcomes. However, the specific mechanisms accounting for these outcomes are unknown. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and its supplements, SEM was used to test a hypothesized longitudinal chain of mediating processes. Framed by the parent investment model, this study tracks children and their parents over twenty-seven years, from pre-birth to early adulthood. The analytic sample was comprised of 1247 young people who were between 6-12 years of age (M= 5.66, SD= 2.12) in 1997, the first wave of the PSID's Child Development Supplement. This analytic sample was roughly equivalent by gender (N= 774; 53% identified as female and N= 693; 47% identified as male). The racial/ethnic background of participants was nearly an equal split between individuals who identified as White (N= 666; 45%) or Black (N= 634; 43%), with an additional 7% (N= 97) who identified as ""Hispanic,"" 2% (N= 40) as ""Other,"" 1% (N= 20) as Asian or Pacific Islander, and less than 1% (N= 6) who identified as American Indian or Alaskan Native. The results indicated that wealth (a) engenders parental and child processes-primarily expectations and achievement-that promote educational success, (b) plays a different role across the life course, and (c) that pre-birth wealth has a significant mediated relationship to educational attainment seventeen years later. These findings advance understanding of specific mediating mechanisms by which wealth may foster children's educational success across the life course, as well as how wealth may differentially shape educational outcomes in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood.",Journal of youth and adolescence,"[""wealth"", ""play"", ""pervasive"", ""role"", ""sustain"", ""inequality"", ""inequitably"", ""distribute"", ""household"", ""income"", ""research"", ""identify"", ""wealth"", ""contribute"", ""child"", ""educational"", ""outcome"", ""however"", ""specific"", ""mechanism"", ""account"", ""outcome"", ""unknown"", ""use"", ""panel"", ""income"", ""dynamic"", ""psid"", ""supplement"", ""sem"", ""use"", ""test"", ""hypothesize"", ""longitudinal"", ""chain"", ""mediating"", ""process"", ""frame"", ""parent"", ""investment"", ""model"", ""track"", ""child"", ""parent"", ""twenty"", ""seven"", ""year"", ""pre"", ""birth"", ""early"", ""adulthood"", ""analytic"", ""sample"", ""comprise"", ""1247"", ""young"", ""people"", ""6"", ""12"", ""year"", ""age"", ""5"", ""66"", ""sd"", ""2"", ""12"", ""1997"", ""first"", ""wave"", ""psid"", ""child"", ""development"", ""supplement"", ""analytic"", ""sample"", ""roughly"", ""equivalent"", ""gender"", ""n"", ""774"", ""53"", ""identify"", ""female"", ""n"", ""693"", ""47"", ""identify"", ""male"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""background"", ""participant"", ""nearly"", ""equal"", ""split"", ""individual"", ""identify"", ""white"", ""n"", ""666"", ""45"", ""black"", ""n"", ""634"", ""43"", ""additional"", ""7"", ""n"", ""97"", ""identify"", ""hispanic"", ""2"", ""n"", ""40"", ""1"", ""n"", ""20"", ""asian"", ""pacific"", ""islander"", ""less"", ""1"", ""n"", ""6"", ""identify"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""alaskan"", ""native"", ""indicate"", ""wealth"", ""engender"", ""parental"", ""child"", ""process"", ""primarily"", ""expectation"", ""achievement"", ""promote"", ""educational"", ""success"", ""b"", ""play"", ""different"", ""role"", ""across"", ""life"", ""course"", ""c"", ""pre"", ""birth"", ""wealth"", ""mediated"", ""relationship"", ""educational"", ""attainment"", ""seventeen"", ""year"", ""later"", ""finding"", ""advance"", ""understand"", ""specific"", ""mediate"", ""mechanism"", ""wealth"", ""may"", ""foster"", ""child"", ""educational"", ""success"", ""across"", ""life"", ""course"", ""well"", ""wealth"", ""may"", ""differentially"", ""shape"", ""educational"", ""outcome"", ""childhood"", ""adolescence"", ""young"", ""adulthood""]",None,None,None,"Black, Asian, Hispanic"

"Ethnic identity, perceived support, and depressive symptoms among racial minority immigrant-origin adolescents.","Although racial minority immigrant-origin adolescents compose a rapidly growing sector of the U.S. population, few studies have examined the role of contextual factors in mental health among these youth. The present study examined the relationship between ethnic identity and depressive symptoms, the relationship between perceived social support and depressive symptoms, and the relationship between sociodemographic factors (ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status) and depressive symptoms, among a culturally diverse group of adolescents. In addition, the potential moderating role of nativity status (U.S. born vs. foreign born) was examined in these associations. Participants were 9th and 10th graders (N = 341; 141 foreign born and 200 U.S. born, from Asian, Latino(a), and Afro-Caribbean backgrounds), attending an urban high school. Consistent with previous research, ethnic identity was negatively associated with depressive symptomatology in the overall sample. Nativity status did not moderate the relationship between ethnic identity and depressive symptoms. Among the sociodemographic factors examined, only gender was associated with depressive symptoms, with girls reporting higher levels of depressive symptoms compared with boys.

Parent-child mealtime interactions in racially/ethnically diverse families with preschool-age children.,"Family meals may improve diet and weight outcomes in children; however, results from nationally representative samples suggest that these relationships vary by race/ethnicity. Observing parent-child mealtime interactions may lend insight to why racial/ethnic differences exist. In this pilot study, a multi-ethnic sample of low-income families (n = 30) with a preschool-age child was videotaped during a dinner in their home. A global coding scheme was used to assess the following: 'Action' (behaviors that divert attention from eating), 'Behavior Control' (behaviors intended to modify another person's behavior), and 'Communication' (i.e., meal-oriented, interpersonal, and critical). All families spent a significant amount of time in 'action' oriented behaviors that diverted their attention from eating. We also observed racial/ethnic differences in communication (i.e. critical) and behavior patterns (i.e. behavior control). This study demonstrated that this approach for observing parent-child mealtime interactions in a naturalistic setting among a diverse study sample was feasible; however, future studies should address how these patterns relate to dietary intake and weight status.",Eating behaviors,"[""family"", ""meal"", ""may"", ""improve"", ""diet"", ""weight"", ""outcome"", ""child"", ""however"", ""nationally"", ""representative"", ""sample"", ""suggest"", ""relationship"", ""vary"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""observe"", ""parent"", ""child"", ""mealtime"", ""interaction"", ""may"", ""lend"", ""insight"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""exist"", ""pilot"", ""multi"", ""ethnic"", ""sample"", ""low"", ""income"", ""family"", ""n"", ""30"", ""preschool"", ""age"", ""child"", ""videotape"", ""dinner"", ""home"", ""global"", ""coding"", ""scheme"", ""use"", ""assess"", ""follow"", ""action"", ""behavior"", ""divert"", ""attention"", ""eat"", ""behavior"", ""behavior"", ""intend"", ""modify"", ""another"", ""person"", ""behavior"", ""communication"", ""e"", ""meal"", ""orient"", ""interpersonal"", ""critical"", ""family"", ""spend"", ""amount"", ""time"", ""action"", ""orient"", ""behavior"", ""divert"", ""attention"", ""eating"", ""also"", ""observe"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""communication"", ""e"", ""critical"", ""behavior"", ""pattern"", ""e"", ""behavior"", ""demonstrate"", ""approach"", ""observe"", ""parent"", ""child"", ""mealtime"", ""interaction"", ""naturalistic"", ""setting"", ""among"", ""diverse"", ""sample"", ""feasible"", ""however"", ""future"", ""study"", ""address"", ""pattern"", ""relate"", ""dietary"", ""intake"", ""weight"", ""status""]",None,None,None,None

Identifying central symptoms of eating disorders among ethnic and racial minority women.,"Experiencing eating disorder symptoms is associated with maladaptive outcomes and impairment in functioning. A paucity of research exists examining eating disorder symptoms among ethnic/racial minority women. Using a network analysis, we evaluated core symptoms of eating disorder psychopathology and the degree of association between eating disorder symptoms in a sample of ethnic/racial minority women. Participants were 296 Black, 261 Hispanic, and 261 Asian American women recruited across the United States to complete an online survey. Inclusionary criteria yielded a sample with high eating disorder psychopathology. The Network Comparison Test was used to identify differences in networks between groups and yielded no significant differences between the three ethnic/racial groups. Thus, one network analysis on the entire sample was conducted in the main analyses. However, separate group analyses are presented in the online supplemental materials. Consistent with the transdiagnostic theory of eating disorders, weight concerns (i.e., strong desire to lose weight and fear of weight gain) emerged as central symptoms. Discrepant from findings with predominantly White samples, purging emerged as a central symptom as well, while shape concerns did not. Interestingly, having to weigh oneself weekly, having a flat stomach, fasting, and compulsive exercising were on the periphery of the network. Findings are discussed in terms of clinical implications and comparative similarities and differences when addressing the existing literature.

"""I Just Want to Be Me, Authentically"": Identity Shifting Among Racially and Ethnically Diverse Young Adults.","Identity shifting represents a common but complex social, behavioral, and cognitive phenomenon. However, some forms of identity shifting originate in response to structural, institutional, and interpersonal marginalization enacted on lower status groups, such as people of color in the United States.

Medication Use Among Ethnically Diverse Older Adults in the United States.,"As primary consumers of health care and prescription medication, older adults are more susceptible to potential drug-related adverse effects and medication interactions.

Results revealed that number of illnesses, income level, and age were three major predictors associated with polypharmacy. No underprescription was identified. Overall, prevalence of polypharmacy was 47.5%. European American individuals had the highest prevalence followed by Hispanic American, African American, and Afro-Caribbean individuals.

"Patterns of adversity and pathways to health among White, Black, and Latinx youth.","Research has demonstrated the negative impact of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) on long-term trajectories of mental and physical health. Yet existing literature on this topic is limited in its understanding of outcomes among youth samples, optimal measurement items and methods, and differences in adverse experiences across race/ethnicity. The current study used a person-centered approach to measure ACEs and their impact on youth health outcomes across three different racial/ethnic groups from a large national database. Patterns of exposure to adverse experiences among Black, Latinx, and White youth (N = 30,668, ages 12-17) were determined empirically using latent class analysis (LCA). Significant differences in class membership by demographic indicators (age, household income, sex) and concurrent health outcomes were identified. Different models emerged for Black (2 classes), Latinx (3 classes), and White youth (3 classes). Older and lower-income youth were more likely to have experienced adversities, but there were no differences in adversity likelihood by sex. Additionally, racial/ethnic minority youth were at greater risk of experiencing higher levels of adversity, poverty, and poor health when compared to their White counterparts. Rather than occuring in meaningful clusters, adverse experiences among youth reflected a cumulative risk model such that classes were defined by the overall intensity of adverse experiences (i.e., low, moderate, high).

"Influenza-Related Hospitalizations and Poverty Levels - United States, 2010-2012.","Annual influenza vaccine is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months in the United States, with recognition that some persons are at risk for more severe disease (1). However, there might be previously unrecognized demographic groups that also experience higher rates of serious influenza-related disease that could benefit from enhanced vaccination efforts. Socioeconomic status (SES) measures that are area-based can be used to define demographic groups when individual SES data are not available (2). Previous surveillance data analyses in limited geographic areas indicated that influenza-related hospitalization incidence was higher for persons residing in census tracts that included a higher percentage of persons living below the federal poverty level (3-5). To determine whether this association occurs elsewhere, influenza hospitalization data collected in 14 FluSurv-NET sites covering 27 million persons during the 2010-11 and 2011-12 influenza seasons were analyzed. The age-adjusted incidence of influenza-related hospitalizations per 100,000 person-years in high poverty (≥20% of persons living below the federal poverty level) census tracts was 21.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.7-22.4), nearly twice the incidence in low poverty (<5% of persons living below the federal poverty level) census tracts (10.9, 95% CI: 10.3-11.4). This relationship was observed in each surveillance site, among children and adults, and across racial/ethnic groups. These findings suggest that persons living in poorer census tracts should be targeted for enhanced influenza vaccination outreach and clinicians serving these persons should be made aware of current recommendations for use of antiviral agents to treat influenza (6).",MMWR.

Racial segregation and maternal smoking during pregnancy: a multilevel analysis using the racial segregation interaction index.,"Drawing from both the place stratification and ethnic enclave perspectives, we use multilevel modeling to investigate the relationships between women's race/ethnicity (i.e., non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Asian, and Hispanic) and maternal smoking during pregnancy, and examine if these relationships are moderated by racial segregation in the continental United States. The results show that increased interaction with whites is associated with increased probability of maternal smoking during pregnancy, and racial segregation moderates the relationships between race/ethnicity and maternal smoking. Specifically, living in a less racially segregated area is related to a lower probability of smoking during pregnancy for black women, but it could double and almost triple the probability of smoking for Asian women and Hispanic women, respectively.

Immigration transition and sleep-related symptoms experienced during menopausal transition.,"The transition due to immigration from one country to another country (referred to as immigration transition henceforth) is inherently stressful, placing an additional dimension of stress to midlife women in the menopausal transition. However, few studies have examined the association of immigration to sleep-related symptoms experienced by midlife women in the menopausal transition. The authors' purpose for this study was to explore the associations of immigration to sleep-related symptoms among four major racial/ethnic groups of 1,054 midlife women in the United States. This was a secondary analysis of data from two national surveys that were collected from 2005 to 2013. The instruments included questions on background characteristics, health and menopausal status, immigration transition, and the Sleep Index for Midlife Women. The data were analyzed using t-tests, chi-square tests, correlation analyses, and hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Immigrants reported fewer total numbers of and lower total severity scores of sleep-related symptoms than non-immigrants (p < .01). Yet, when background characteristics and health and menopausal status were controlled, self-reported racial/ethnic identity was the only significant factor associated with sleep-related symptoms (ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.02, p < .01).

Social status correlates of reporting gender discrimination and racial discrimination among racially diverse women.,"The growing body of research on discrimination and health indicates a deleterious effect of discrimination on various health outcomes. However, less is known about the sociodemographic correlates of reporting racial discrimination and gender discrimination among racially diverse women. We examined the associations of social status characteristics with lifetime experiences of racial discrimination and gender discrimination using a racially-diverse sample of 754 women attending family planning clinics in North California (11.4% African American, 16.8% Latina, 10.1% Asian and 61.7% Caucasian). A multivariate analysis revealed that race, financial difficulty and marital status were significantly correlated with higher reports of racial discrimination, while race, education, financial difficulty and nativity were significantly correlated with gender discrimination scores. Our findings suggest that the social patterning of perceiving racial discrimination is somewhat different from that of gender discrimination.

Latina and African American women: continuing disparities in health.,"Women of all races have faced incredible challenges as they sought to realize the promises of America. For women of color, these challenges were compounded by the second-class citizenship of U.S. racial and ethnic minority population groups. In an effort to assess the quality of life experienced by Latina and African American women, this article provides descriptive information on racial/ethnic differences in women's social conditions, health status, exposure to occupational and environmental risks, and use of health services. When possible, indices are stratified by family income to limit the effects of social class on the comparison of racial differences. The authors provide evidence that Latina and African American women are more likely than nonminority women to encounter social environments (e.g., poverty, densely populated neighborhoods, hazardous work conditions) that place them at risk for ill-health and injury. Although persistent racial disparities in health are often attributed to the lifestyle behaviors of racial minority populations, they are undoubtedly a consequence of poorer social conditions as well as barriers in access to quality health services. To achieve further gains, public policies must reduce social inequalities (i.e., by gender, race, and social class) and assure greater equity in access to resources that facilitate healthier environments and lifestyles. Public health initiatives should be community-based, reflecting a shared partnership that actively engages minority women in decision-making about their lives.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation","[""woman"", ""race"", ""face"", ""incredible"", ""challenge"", ""seek"", ""realize"", ""promise"", ""america"", ""woman"", ""color"", ""challenge"", ""compound"", ""second"", ""class"", ""citizenship"", ""u"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""population"", ""group"", ""effort"", ""assess"", ""quality"", ""life"", ""experience"", ""latina"", ""african"", ""american"", ""woman"", ""article"", ""provide"", ""descriptive"", ""information"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""woman"", ""social"", ""condition"", ""health"", ""status"", ""exposure"", ""occupational"", ""environmental"", ""risk"", ""use"", ""health"", ""service"", ""possible"", ""index"", ""stratify"", ""family"", ""income"", ""limit"", ""effect"", ""social"", ""class"", ""comparison"", ""racial"", ""difference"", ""author"", ""provide"", ""evidence"", ""latina"", ""african"", ""american"", ""woman"", ""likely"", ""nonminority"", ""woman"", ""encounter"", ""social"", ""environment"", ""e"", ""g"", ""poverty"", ""densely"", ""populated"", ""neighborhood"", ""hazardous"", ""work"", ""condition"", ""place"", ""risk"", ""ill"", ""health"", ""injury"", ""although"", ""persistent"", ""racial"", ""disparity"", ""health"", ""often"", ""attribute"", ""lifestyle"", ""behavior"", ""racial"", ""minority"", ""population"", ""undoubtedly"", ""consequence"", ""poor"", ""social"", ""condition"", ""well"", ""barrier"", ""access"", ""quality"", ""health"", ""service"", ""achieve"", ""gain"", ""public"", ""policy"", ""must"", ""reduce"", ""social"", ""inequality"", ""e"", ""gender"", ""race"", ""social"", ""class"", ""assure"", ""great"", ""equity"", ""access"", ""resource"", ""facilitate"", ""healthy"", ""environment"", ""lifestyle"", ""public"", ""health"", ""initiative"", ""community"", ""base"", ""reflect"", ""shared"", ""partnership"", ""actively"", ""engage"", ""minority"", ""woman"", ""decision"", ""make"", ""life""]",None,None,"poverty, social class",None

Social Identity in New Mexicans of Spanish-Speaking Descent Highlights Limitations of Using Standardized Ethnic Terminology in Research.,"In this study, we evaluated the extent to which regional history has shaped the social identity nomenclature in New Mexicans of Spanish-speaking descent (NMSD). We asked 507 NMSD to list the social-identity terms they used to describe themselves and their parents, and we examined the correspondence between these choices and family ties to the region, birthplace, and continental ancestry. NMSD frequently identified using the regional terms ""Nuevomexicano/a"" (15%) and ""Spanish"" (12%). These individuals reported family ties to the region that predate New Mexican statehood. They and their parents were frequently born in New Mexico, frequently chose the other of the two terms as a secondary descriptor, and frequently ascribed one of the two terms to their parents. About 10% of NMSD identified as ""Mexican American"" and ""Mexican."" About 25% of these individuals, and more than half of their parents, were born in Mexico. They also frequently chose the other of the two terms as a secondary descriptor and frequently ascribed one of the two terms to their parents. Compared to NMSD who identified as ""Mexican"" and ""Mexican American,"" individuals who identified as ""Nuevomexicano/a"" and ""Spanish"" had higher European ancestry and lower Native American and African ancestry. Our results also suggest that the term ""Hispanic,"" frequently chosen as both a primary and secondary social identity term by NMSD, may, as it continues to rise in prominence, mask more deeply rooted and potential socially relevant aspects of social identity in New Mexico. More broadly, these results indicate that regional history influences social identity nomenclatures in ways that are potentially incompatible with US Office of Management and Budget standards. This incompatibility may adversely affect the ability of researchers in the social sciences to assess the causes of social inequality and health disparities in individuals of Spanish-speaking descent in different regions of the United States.

Ethnic variation in risk for osteoporosis among women: a review of biological and behavioral factors.,"Most studies of risk factors for osteoporosis and nontraumatic fracture involve white women, although more research is being geared toward bone health among various ethnic groups. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of health disparity in osteoporosis, including assessment of bone mineral density (BMD), bone health screening, lifestyle risk factors, and treatment involving white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. This review summarizes evidence that white, Asian, Hispanic, and Native American women are more at risk for osteoporosis than black women. These conclusions are supported by the disparity in BMD between white and black women, although the reason for this biological difference is not well characterized. Additional research is needed to determine if there is a significant difference in BMD among Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women independent of body weight and size. Similarly, there is also disparity in fracture rates, with the causes presumed to be multifactorial. Calcium intake is lower than recommended in all females at all ages; however, it is much lower in black and Native American women and highest in white and Hispanic women. Black women also have a lower vitamin D status than white women, with mean vitamin D status of Hispanic American women lying between that of black and white women. Similarly, although white women are more active than black and Hispanic women at all ages, data are lacking about physical activity habits of women of other ethnic backgrounds and how this impacts bone health. Finally, screening protocols for women of various ethnicities and effectiveness of treatments are not well established and remain a priority in women's health.",Journal of women's health (2002),"[""study"", ""risk"", ""factor"", ""osteoporosis"", ""nontraumatic"", ""fracture"", ""involve"", ""white"", ""woman"", ""although"", ""research"", ""gear"", ""toward"", ""bone"", ""health"", ""among"", ""various"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""purpose"", ""review"", ""provide"", ""overview"", ""health"", ""disparity"", ""osteoporosis"", ""include"", ""assessment"", ""bone"", ""mineral"", ""density"", ""bmd"", ""bone"", ""health"", ""screening"", ""lifestyle"", ""risk"", ""factor"", ""treatment"", ""involve"", ""white"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""native"", ""american"", ""woman"", ""review"", ""summarize"", ""evidence"", ""white"", ""asian"", ""hispanic"", ""native"", ""american"", ""woman"", ""risk"", ""osteoporosis"", ""black"", ""woman"", ""conclusion"", ""support"", ""disparity"", ""bmd"", ""white"", ""black"", ""woman"", ""although"", ""reason"", ""biological"", ""difference"", ""well"", ""characterize"", ""additional"", ""research"", ""need"", ""determine"", ""difference"", ""bmd"", ""among"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""native"", ""american"", ""woman"", ""independent"", ""body"", ""weight"", ""size"", ""similarly"", ""also"", ""disparity"", ""fracture"", ""rate"", ""cause"", ""presume"", ""multifactorial"", ""calcium"", ""intake"", ""lower"", ""recommend"", ""female"", ""age"", ""however"", ""much"", ""low"", ""black"", ""native"", ""american"", ""woman"", ""high"", ""white"", ""hispanic"", ""woman"", ""black"", ""woman"", ""also"", ""low"", ""vitamin"", ""status"", ""white"", ""woman"", ""mean"", ""vitamin"", ""status"", ""hispanic"", ""american"", ""woman"", ""lie"", ""black"", ""white"", ""woman"", ""similarly"", ""although"", ""white"", ""woman"", ""active"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""woman"", ""age"", ""datum"", ""lack"", ""physical"", ""activity"", ""habit"", ""woman"", ""ethnic"", ""background"", ""impact"", ""bone"", ""health"", ""finally"", ""screen"", ""protocol"", ""woman"", ""various"", ""ethnicity"", ""effectiveness"", ""treatment"", ""well"", ""establish"", ""remain"", ""priority"", ""woman"", ""health""]",None,None,None,"Black, Asian, Native American, Hispanic"

Racial and ethnic disparities in mental illness stigma.,"The present study sought to examine whether racial/ethnic differences exist in stigmatizing attitudes towards people with mental illness among community college students. Multiple regression models were used to investigate racial/ethnic differences in students' perceived dangerousness and desire for segregation from persons with mental illness both before and after participation in an antistigma intervention. At baseline, African Americans and Asians perceived people with mental illness as more dangerous and wanted more segregation than Caucasians, and Latinos perceived people with mental illness as less dangerous and wanted less segregation than Caucasians. Similar patterns emerged postintervention, except that Asians' perceptions changed significantly such that they tended to perceive people with mental illness as least dangerous of all the racial/ethnic groups. These findings suggest that racial/ethnic background may help to shape mental illness stigma, and that targeting antistigma interventions to racial/ethnic background of participants may be helpful.",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,"[""present"", ""seek"", ""examine"", ""whether"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""exist"", ""stigmatizing"", ""attitude"", ""towards"", ""people"", ""mental"", ""illness"", ""among"", ""community"", ""college"", ""student"", ""multiple"", ""regression"", ""model"", ""use"", ""investigate"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""student"", ""perceive"", ""dangerousness"", ""desire"", ""segregation"", ""person"", ""mental"", ""illness"", ""participation"", ""antistigma"", ""intervention"", ""baseline"", ""african"", ""american"", ""asian"", ""perceive"", ""people"", ""mental"", ""illness"", ""dangerous"", ""wanted"", ""segregation"", ""caucasian"", ""latinos"", ""perceive"", ""people"", ""mental"", ""illness"", ""less"", ""dangerous"", ""want"", ""less"", ""segregation"", ""caucasian"", ""similar"", ""pattern"", ""emerge"", ""postintervention"", ""except"", ""asians"", ""perception"", ""change"", ""significantly"", ""tend"", ""perceive"", ""people"", ""mental"", ""illness"", ""least"", ""dangerous"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""finding"", ""suggest"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""background"", ""may"", ""help"", ""shape"", ""mental"", ""illness"", ""stigma"", ""target"", ""antistigma"", ""intervention"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""background"", ""participant"", ""may"", ""helpful""]",None,None,None,"Latino, Caucasian, Asian"
Attitudes of women in midlife to web-based interventions for promoting physical activity.,"We explored the attitudes of women at midlife to web-based interventions for promoting physical activity. 145 women volunteered to participate in one of four online forums. The forums were for four major racial/ethnic groups. 90 volunteers were recruited for the online forums (29 Whites, 23 Hispanics, 21 African Americans, and 17 Asians). Two sets of topics on attitudes to physical activity and racial/ethnic contexts were used. Each topic had some introductory questions and related prompts, and these were posted on the online forum sites in a serial fashion during the six-month period. We used a thematic analysis. Four major themes emerged: (1) 'a matter of the source of the information'; (2) 'I can pace myself'; (3) 'lack of interpersonal interactions'; and (4) 'culture-specificity and low cost.' The women in all ethnic groups thought that the source of the information was much more important than the medium of the information (e.g. web-based, booklet or face-to-face). They liked the self-controllability in web-based interventions. They preferred web-based interventions to other types of interventions because of easy accessibility, but they were concerned about lack of interpersonal interaction. None of the White or African American women indicated the need for culture-specificity in web-based interventions, but Hispanic and Asian women indicated that culture-specific interventions should be provided.

"Self-reported ethnicity, genetic structure and the impact of population stratification in a multiethnic study.","It is well-known that population substructure may lead to confounding in case-control association studies. Here, we examined genetic structure in a large racially and ethnically diverse sample consisting of five ethnic groups of the Multiethnic Cohort study (African Americans, Japanese Americans, Latinos, European Americans and Native Hawaiians) using 2,509 SNPs distributed across the genome. Principal component analysis on 6,213 study participants, 18 Native Americans and 11 HapMap III populations revealed four important principal components (PCs): the first two separated Asians, Europeans and Africans, and the third and fourth corresponded to Native American and Native Hawaiian (Polynesian) ancestry, respectively. Individual ethnic composition derived from self-reported parental information matched well to genetic ancestry for Japanese and European Americans. STRUCTURE-estimated individual ancestral proportions for African Americans and Latinos are consistent with previous reports. We quantified the East Asian (mean 27%), European (mean 27%) and Polynesian (mean 46%) ancestral proportions for the first time, to our knowledge, for Native Hawaiians. Simulations based on realistic settings of case-control studies nested in the Multiethnic Cohort found that the effect of population stratification was modest and readily corrected by adjusting for race/ethnicity or by adjusting for top PCs derived from all SNPs or from ancestry informative markers; the power of these approaches was similar when averaged across causal variants simulated based on allele frequencies of the 2,509 genotyped markers. The bias may be large in case-only analysis of gene by gene interactions but it can be corrected by top PCs derived from all SNPs.",Human genetics,"[""well"", ""known"", ""population"", ""substructure"", ""may"", ""lead"", ""confounding"", ""case"", ""association"", ""study"", ""examine"", ""genetic"", ""structure"", ""large"", ""racially"", ""ethnically"", ""diverse"", ""sample"", ""consist"", ""five"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""multiethnic"", ""cohort"", ""african"", ""american"", ""japanese"", ""american"", ""latinos"", ""european"", ""american"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""use"", ""2"", ""509"", ""snps"", ""distribute"", ""across"", ""genome"", ""principal"", ""component"", ""analysis"", ""6"", ""213"", ""participant"", ""18"", ""native"", ""american"", ""11"", ""hapmap"", ""iii"", ""population"", ""reveal"", ""four"", ""important"", ""principal"", ""component"", ""pcs"", ""first"", ""two"", ""separate"", ""asian"", ""european"", ""african"", ""third"", ""fourth"", ""correspond"", ""native"", ""american"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""polynesian"", ""ancestry"", ""respectively"", ""individual"", ""ethnic"", ""composition"", ""derive"", ""self"", ""report"", ""parental"", ""information"", ""match"", ""well"", ""genetic"", ""ancestry"", ""japanese"", ""european"", ""american"", ""structure"", ""estimate"", ""individual"", ""ancestral"", ""proportion"", ""african"", ""american"", ""latinos"", ""consistent"", ""previous"", ""report"", ""quantify"", ""east"", ""asian"", ""mean"", ""27"", ""european"", ""mean"", ""27"", ""polynesian"", ""mean"", ""46"", ""ancestral"", ""proportion"", ""first"", ""time"", ""knowledge"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""simulation"", ""base"", ""realistic"", ""setting"", ""case"", ""study"", ""nest"", ""multiethnic"", ""cohort"", ""find"", ""effect"", ""population"", ""stratification"", ""modest"", ""readily"", ""correct"", ""adjust"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""adjust"", ""top"", ""pcs"", ""derive"", ""snps"", ""ancestry"", ""informative"", ""marker"", ""power"", ""approach"", ""similar"", ""average"", ""across"", ""causal"", ""variant"", ""simulated"", ""base"", ""allele"", ""frequency"", ""2"", ""509"", ""genotype"", ""marker"", ""bias"", ""may"", ""large"", ""case"", ""analysis"", ""gene"", ""gene"", ""interaction"", ""correct"", ""top"", ""pcs"", ""derive"", ""snps""]",None,None,None,"Latino, Asian, Native American"
Racial/ethnic disparities in depression: Investigating how sources of support and types of integration matter.,"Although social support and social integration are key predictors of depression and exhibit racial/ethnic patterns in the US, previous research has not examined how they shape racial/ethnic disparities in depression. Applying hybrid models to data from the Americans' Changing Lives study from 1986 to 2002, this study analyzes how sources of social support (spouse and friend/relative) and types of social integration (informal/formal) explain black-white and Hispanic-white disparities in depression. We find that strong social support and high social integration are negatively associated with depression and that the patterns of social support and integration vary by race/ethnicity. The results of hybrid models show that social support from one's spouse and friend/relative account for over 25 percent of the black-white disparity, whereas formal social integration including religious groups widens the black-white differential by roughly 10 percent. However, Hispanic-white disparities in depression are mostly a result of the difference in socioeconomic status. The change in spousal support is the most powerful predictor for the change in depression across race/ethnicity groups.

"Disparities in Adult Cigarette Smoking - United States, 2002-2005 and 2010-2013.","Although cigarette smoking has substantially declined since the release of the 1964 Surgeon General's report on smoking and health,* disparities in tobacco use exist among racial/ethnic populations (1). Moreover, because estimates of U.S. adult cigarette smoking and tobacco use are usually limited to aggregate racial or ethnic population categories (i.e., non-Hispanic whites [whites]; non-Hispanic blacks or African Americans [blacks]; American Indians and Alaska Natives [American Indians/Alaska Natives]; Asians; Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders [Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders]; and Hispanics/Latinos [Hispanics]), these estimates can mask differences in cigarette smoking prevalence among subgroups of these populations. To assess the prevalence of and changes in cigarette smoking among persons aged ≥18 years in six racial/ethnic populations and 10 select subgroups in the United States,(†) CDC analyzed self-reported data collected during 2002-2005 and 2010-2013 from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) (2) and compared differences between the two periods. During 2010-2013, the overall prevalence of cigarette smoking among the racial/ethnic populations and subgroups ranged from 38.9% for American Indians/Alaska Natives to 7.6% for both Chinese and Asian Indians. During 2010-2013, although cigarette smoking prevalence was relatively low among Asians overall (10.9%) compared with whites (24.9%), wide within-group differences in smoking prevalence existed among Asian subgroups, from 7.6% among both Chinese and Asian Indians to 20.0% among Koreans. Similarly, among Hispanics, the overall prevalence of current cigarette smoking was 19.9%; however, within Hispanic subgroups, prevalences ranged from 15.6% among Central/South Americans to 28.5% among Puerto Ricans. The overall prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among men than among women during both 2002-2005 (30.0% men versus 23.9% women) and 2010-2013 (26.4% versus 21.1%) (p<0.05).

Ethnic/racial disparities in adolescents' home food environments and linkages to dietary intake and weight status.,"Research is needed to confirm that public health recommendations for home/family food environments are equally relevant for diverse populations. This study examined ethnic/racial differences in the home/family environments of adolescents and associations with dietary intake and weight status. The sample included 2374 ethnically/racially diverse adolescents and their parents enrolled in coordinated studies, EAT 2010 (Eating and Activity in Teens) and Project F-EAT (Families and Eating and Activity in Teens), in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area. Adolescents and parents completed surveys and adolescents completed anthropometric measurements in 2009-2010. Nearly all home/family environment variables (n=7 of 8 examined) were found to vary significantly across the ethnic/racial groups. Several of the home/family food environment variables were significantly associated with one or more adolescent outcome in expected directions. For example, parental modeling of healthy food choices was inversely associated with BMI z-score (p=0.03) and positively associated with fruit/vegetable consumption (p<0.001). Most observed associations were applicable across ethnic/racial groups; however; eight relationships were found to differ by ethnicity/race. For example, parental encouragement for healthy eating was associated with lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages only among youth representing the White, African American, Asian, and mixed/other ethnic/racial groups and was unrelated to intake among East African, Hispanic, and Native American youth.

Racial and ethnic stratification in the relationship between homeownership and self-rated health.,"Social scientists have long demonstrated that socioeconomic resources benefit health. More recently, scholars have begun to examine the potential stratification in the health returns different groups receive for a given resource. Motivated by fundamental cause theory, this paper examines homeownership as a salient health resource with potentially stratified benefits. Homeowners have significantly greater housing quality, wealth, neighborhood quality and integration, and physical and mental health than renters. However, there are compelling theoretical reasons to expect the health advantage of homeownership to be unequally distributed across racial and ethnic groups. Regression analyses of 71,874 household heads in the United States from the 2012 March Current Population Survey initially suggest all homeowners experience a significant health advantage. Further examination finds robust evidence for a homeowner health advantage among Whites, on par with the difference between the married and divorced. The advantage among minority households is considerably smaller, and not significant among Latinos or Asians. Conditioning on a broad array of observable characteristics, White homeowners emerge as exceptionally healthy compared to White renters and all minority groups. This leads to the unexpected finding that racial/ethnic differences in health are concentrated among homeowners. The findings demonstrate the interactive nature of racial/ethnic stratification in health through both access to and returns from socioeconomic resources.",Social science & medicine (1982),"[""social"", ""scientist"", ""long"", ""demonstrate"", ""socioeconomic"", ""resource"", ""benefit"", ""health"", ""recently"", ""scholar"", ""begin"", ""examine"", ""potential"", ""stratification"", ""health"", ""return"", ""different"", ""group"", ""receive"", ""given"", ""resource"", ""motivate"", ""fundamental"", ""cause"", ""theory"", ""paper"", ""examine"", ""homeownership"", ""salient"", ""health"", ""resource"", ""potentially"", ""stratify"", ""benefit"", ""homeowner"", ""significantly"", ""great"", ""housing"", ""quality"", ""wealth"", ""neighborhood"", ""quality"", ""integration"", ""physical"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""renter"", ""however"", ""compelling"", ""theoretical"", ""reason"", ""expect"", ""health"", ""advantage"", ""homeownership"", ""unequally"", ""distribute"", ""across"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""regression"", ""analysis"", ""71"", ""874"", ""household"", ""head"", ""unite"", ""state"", ""2012"", ""march"", ""current"", ""population"", ""survey"", ""initially"", ""suggest"", ""homeowner"", ""experience"", ""health"", ""advantage"", ""examination"", ""find"", ""robust"", ""evidence"", ""homeowner"", ""health"", ""advantage"", ""among"", ""white"", ""par"", ""difference"", ""marry"", ""divorced"", ""advantage"", ""among"", ""minority"", ""household"", ""considerably"", ""small"", ""among"", ""latinos"", ""asian"", ""condition"", ""broad"", ""array"", ""observable"", ""characteristic"", ""white"", ""homeowner"", ""emerge"", ""exceptionally"", ""healthy"", ""compare"", ""white"", ""renter"", ""minority"", ""group"", ""lead"", ""unexpected"", ""find"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""health"", ""concentrate"", ""among"", ""homeowner"", ""finding"", ""demonstrate"", ""interactive"", ""nature"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""stratification"", ""health"", ""access"", ""return"", ""socioeconomic"", ""resource""]",None,None,None,"Latino, Asian"

Factors Associated With Volunteering Among Racial/Ethnic Groups: Findings From the California Health Interview Survey.,"The present study investigated how volunteering was influenced by individual resources and social capital among four racial/ethnic groups of adults aged 50 and older. The data came from the California Health Interview Survey, a statewide sample that includes non-Hispanic Whites ( n = 18,927), non-Hispanic Asians ( n = 2,428), non-Hispanic Blacks ( n = 1,265), and Hispanics ( n = 3,799). Logistic regression models of volunteering were estimated to explore the effects of human and social capital within and across the racial/ethnic groups. Compared to Whites, racial/ethnic minority adults volunteered less. Although education was a significant predictor of volunteering across all groups, the findings indicated group-specific factors related to human and social capital.

"Demographic and Regional Trends of Mortality in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction in the United States, 1999 to 2019.","Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)-related mortality has been decreasing within the United States because of improvements in management and preventive efforts; however, persistent disparities in demographic subsets such as race may exist. In this study, the nationwide trends in mortality related to AMI in adults in the United States from 1999 to 2019 are described. Trends in mortality related to AMI were assessed through a cross-sectional analysis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database. Age-adjusted mortality rates per 100,000 people and associated annual percentage change and average annual percentage changes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. Joinpoint regression was used to assess the trends in the overall, demographic (gender, race/ethnicity, age), and regional groups. Between 1999 and 2019, a total of 3,655,274 deaths related to AMI occurred. In the overall population, age-adjusted mortality rates decreased from 134.7 (95% CI 134.2 to 135.3) in 1999 to 48.5 (95% CI 48.3 to 48.8) in 2019 with an average annual percentage change of -5.0 (95% CI -5.5 to -4.6). Higher mortality rates were seen in Black individuals, men, and those living in the South. Patients older than 85 years experienced substantial decreases in mortality.

The experience of panic symptoms across racial groups in a student sample.,"While there is general agreement that, across cultures, panic disorder appears to be characterized by sudden onset of bodily sensations, such as dizziness and heart palpitations, followed by catastrophic misinterpretations of these symptoms, there remains a need for research investigating ethnic/cultural differences in the experience of panic attacks. In addition to investigating ethnic differences in the experience of panic, it is important to assess whether increased endorsement of panic symptoms translates into increased dysfunction. The present study investigated differences in the experience of panic attacks and examined the relation between symptom endorsement and overall distress and impairment in a large multiracial/ethnic student population. Preliminary analyses indicated that although overall endorsement of panic symptoms was similar across groups, differences did emerge on specific symptoms. Participants identifying as Asian tended to endorse symptoms such as dizziness, unsteadiness, choking, and feeling terrified more frequently than those identifying as Caucasian, and individuals identifying as African American reported feeling less nervous than those identifying as Caucasian. Participants of Hispanic/Latino(a) descent showed no differences from any other group on symptom endorsement. Panic symptom severity was not found to differ across racial/ethnic groups; however, the correlation between panic symptoms and panic severity was stronger for Asian and Caucasian participants than for African Americans. These results suggest that symptoms of panic may be experienced differently across racial/ethnic groups, and highlight the need for clinicians and researchers to assess panic symptoms within the context of culture.",Journal of anxiety disorders,"[""general"", ""agreement"", ""across"", ""culture"", ""panic"", ""disorder"", ""appear"", ""characterize"", ""sudden"", ""onset"", ""bodily"", ""sensation"", ""dizziness"", ""heart"", ""palpitation"", ""follow"", ""catastrophic"", ""misinterpretation"", ""symptom"", ""remain"", ""need"", ""research"", ""investigate"", ""ethnic"", ""cultural"", ""difference"", ""experience"", ""panic"", ""attack"", ""addition"", ""investigate"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""experience"", ""panic"", ""important"", ""assess"", ""whether"", ""increase"", ""endorsement"", ""panic"", ""symptom"", ""translate"", ""increase"", ""dysfunction"", ""present"", ""investigate"", ""difference"", ""experience"", ""panic"", ""attack"", ""examine"", ""relation"", ""symptom"", ""endorsement"", ""overall"", ""distress"", ""impairment"", ""large"", ""multiracial"", ""ethnic"", ""student"", ""population"", ""preliminary"", ""analysis"", ""indicate"", ""although"", ""overall"", ""endorsement"", ""panic"", ""symptom"", ""similar"", ""across"", ""group"", ""difference"", ""emerge"", ""specific"", ""symptom"", ""participant"", ""identify"", ""asian"", ""tend"", ""endorse"", ""symptom"", ""dizziness"", ""unsteadiness"", ""choke"", ""feel"", ""terrify"", ""frequently"", ""identify"", ""caucasian"", ""individual"", ""identify"", ""african"", ""american"", ""report"", ""feel"", ""less"", ""nervous"", ""identify"", ""caucasian"", ""participant"", ""hispanic"", ""latino"", ""descent"", ""show"", ""difference"", ""group"", ""symptom"", ""endorsement"", ""panic"", ""symptom"", ""severity"", ""find"", ""differ"", ""across"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""however"", ""correlation"", ""panic"", ""symptom"", ""panic"", ""severity"", ""strong"", ""asian"", ""caucasian"", ""participant"", ""african"", ""american"", ""suggest"", ""symptom"", ""panic"", ""may"", ""experience"", ""differently"", ""across"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""highlight"", ""need"", ""clinician"", ""researcher"", ""assess"", ""panic"", ""symptom"", ""within"", ""context"", ""culture""]",None,None,None,"Latino, Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic"
Prospective Effects of Family Cohesion on Alcohol-Related Problems in Adolescence: Similarities and Differences by Race/Ethnicity.,"Research increasingly finds that race/ethnicity needs to be taken into account in the modelling of associations between protective factors and adolescent drinking behaviors in order to understand family effects and promote positive youth development. The current study examined racial/ethnic variation in the prospective effects of family cohesion on adolescent alcohol-related problems using a nationally representative sample. Data were drawn from the first two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health and included 10,992 (50% female) non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic Black, Latino, and non-Hispanic White 7th-12th graders. Consistent with Hirschi's social control theory of youth delinquency, higher levels of family cohesion predicted lower levels of future adolescent alcohol-related problems, independent of race/ethnicity, sex, age, baseline alcohol-related problems, and family socioeconomic status. Findings from moderation analyses indicated that the magnitude of associations differed across groups such that the protective effect of family cohesion was strongest among White adolescents. For Latino adolescents, family cohesion was not associated with alcohol-related problems. Future longitudinal cross-racial/ethnic research is needed on common and unique mechanisms underlying differential associations between family processes and adolescent high-risk drinking.

Family contexts: parental experiences of discrimination and child mental health.,"Research on the mental health correlates of discrimination traditionally has been intra-individual, focusing exclusively on the individual directly experiencing discrimination. A small number of studies have begun to consider the links between parental experiences of discrimination and child mental health, but little is known about potential underlying mechanisms. The present study tested the independent mediating effects of parent mental health and household socioeconomic status on the associations between parental experiences of discrimination (past-year perceived discrimination and perceptions of being unaccepted culturally) and child mental health (internalizing and externalizing symptoms) using a bootstrapping analytic approach. Data were drawn from racial/ethnic minority (n = 383) and White (n = 574) samples surveyed in an urban Midwestern county. For all measures of discrimination and child mental health, findings supported an association between parental experiences of discrimination and child mental health. Whereas parent mental health served as a significant mediator in all analyses, socioeconomic status did not. Mediation findings held for both the White and racial/ethnic minority samples.

"Parenting style and adolescent depressive symptoms, smoking, and academic achievement: ethnic, gender, and SES differences.","This paper examines whether the relationship between parenting style and adolescent depressive symptoms, smoking, and academic grades varies according to ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status. Four parenting styles are distinguished, based on patterns of parent-adolescent decision making: autocratic (parents decide), authoritative (joint process but parents decide), permissive (joint process but adolescent decides), and unengaged (adolescent decides). The sample included 3993 15-year-old White, Hispanic, African-American, and Asian adolescents. Results are generally consistent with previous findings: adolescents with authoritative parents had the best outcomes and those with unengaged parents were least well adjusted, while the permissive and the autocratic styles produced intermediate results.

Disparities in Receipt of Preventive Dental Services in Children From Low-Income Families.,"Healthy People 2020 includes a goal of increasing use of preventive dental care among children from low-income families.

Racial/ethnic differences of justice-involved youth in substance-related problems and services received.,"This study examined differences in substance-related problems and receipt of substance-specific counseling in 7 different racial/ethnic groups of justice-involved youth. Data came from a nationally representative sample of 7,073 youth in residential placement across 36 states representing 5 program types. Descriptive analyses and regression modeling techniques were used to examine the relationship between race/ethnicity, substance problems, and substance services. Results show that more than 2/3 report a history of at least 1 substance-related problem. Yet, over 12% of youth in residential placement are in programs that do not offer any substance-related services. This has the greatest implications for African American and Hispanic youth, who are most likely to be the programs without these services. Moreover, there are substantive differences in the prevalence of substance problems by race and ethnicity. American Indian/Alaska Natives and multiracial youth were significantly more likely to have substance problems, to be under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol at the time of the current offense, to have a history of substance problems and above average mental health need, and to have a history of substance problems and a lifetime suicide attempt compared to African Americans. Asian youth were similar to African Americans and had lower rates of substance problems. Asian youth were also the least likely to be under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol at the time of the current offense. This study provides important preliminary findings about Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and multiracial justice-involved youth and adds to the knowledge about American Indian/Alaska Native populations.

Physical activity and depressive symptoms in four ethnic groups of midlife women.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the associations between physical activity and depression and the multiple contextual factors influencing these associations in four major ethnic groups of midlife women in the United States. This was a secondary analysis of the data from 542 midlife women. The instruments included questions on background characteristics and health and menopausal status; the Depression Index for Midlife Women (DIMW); and the Kaiser Physical Activity Survey (KPAS). The data were analyzed using chi-square tests, the ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, correlation analyses, and hierarchical multiple regression analyses. The women's depressive symptoms were negatively correlated with active living and sports/exercise physical activities whereas they were positively correlated with occupational physical activities (p < .01).

Racial/Ethnic and nativity differences in birth outcomes among mothers in New York City: the role of social ties and social support.,"Immigrants have lower rates of low birth weight (LBW) and to some extent preterm birth (PTB), than their US-born counterparts. This pattern has been termed the 'immigrant health paradox'. Social ties and support are one proposed explanation for this phenomenon. We examined the contribution of social ties and social support to LBW and PTB by race/ethnicity and nativity among women in New York City (NYC). The NYC Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System survey (2004-2007) data, linked with the selected items from birth certificates, were used to examine LBW and PTB by race/ethnicity and nativity status and the role of social ties and social support to adverse birth outcomes using bivariate and multivariable analyses. SUDAAN software was used to adjust for complex survey design and sampling weights. US- and foreign-born Blacks had significantly increased odds of PTB [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.43, 95 % CI 1.56, 3.77 and AOR = 2.6, 95 % CI 1.66, 4.24, respectively] compared to US-born Whites. Odds of PTB among foreign-born Other Latinas, Island-born Puerto Ricans' and foreign-born Asians' were not significantly different from US-born Whites, while odds of PTB for foreign-born Whites were significantly lower (AOR = 0.47, 95 % CI 0.26, 0.84). US and foreign-born Blacks' odds of LBW were 2.5 fold that of US-born Whites. Fewer social ties were associated with 32-39 % lower odds of PTB. Lower social support was associated with decreased odds of LBW (AOR 0.69, 95 % CI 0.50, 0.96). We found stronger evidence of the immigrant health paradox across racial/ethnic groups for PTB than for LBW.

Body shape concerns across racial and ethnic groups among adults in the United States: More similarities than differences.,"This study evaluated the relationship between race/ethnicity and body shape concerns among adults in the U.S. and evaluated if this relationship varied by Body Mass Index (BMI) and gender. Data were collected from U.S. adults (N = 2,212) using a national online survey panel designed to approximate the US census data. Gender, age, race/ethnicity, BMI and body shape concerns (Body Shape Questionnaire) were assessed. Analysis of variance was utilized to evaluate the race/ethnicity and BSQ association and if the relationship varied by gender and BMI category. The sample (65 % White, 13 % Black/African American, 16 % Latino/Hispanic/Mexican American and 6 % Asian/Pacific Islander) was 50 % female; mean age of 44.2 years (SD = 16.8); BMI of 27.4 (SD = 6.7). A gender by BMI category interaction (p < .01) revealed no difference in BSQ scores by gender when BMI < 18, but higher BSQ scores among women for all other BMI groups. A main effect of race/ethnicity revealed BSQ scores were equally high across racial/ethnic groups, except individuals who identified as White (M = 42.0, SD = 19.7) reported higher BSQ than those identified as Asian/Pacific Islander (M = 37.4, SD = 17.4).

The effect of immigrant generation and duration on self-rated health among US adults 2003-2007.,"Global self-rated health (SRH) is increasingly a key indicator in the assessment of immigrant health. However, evidence of the impact on SRH of generational status, duration of residence in the US, and socioeconomic status (SES) among immigrants and their offspring is limited and inconsistent. We overcome limitations in existing research on this topic by using a uniquely large and diverse data source, the March Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS; 2003-2007) (n = 637,209). As a result, we are able to disaggregate results by race/ethnicity, account for country of origin, and consider the role of multiple dimensions of SES. We find that overall first-generation immigrants in the US have lower odds of poor/fair SRH compared to the third-generation. This association is particularly strong for blacks and Hispanics but not significant for Asians. Among first-generation Asians and Hispanics, longer duration of residence is positively associated with poor/fair SRH. Finally, socioeconomic gradients in SRH tend to be less pronounced among the first-generation (versus the third) and, within the first-generation, among recent arrivals (versus those with longer durations). Our results highlight the importance of explicitly accounting for multiple immigration-related variables and their interactions with race/ethnicity and SES. Otherwise, studies may misestimate SRH differences by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The continued growth of the US immigrant population and the second-generation underscore the need to examine patterns in immigrant health systematically.",Social science & medicine (1982),"[""global"", ""self"", ""rate"", ""health"", ""srh"", ""increasingly"", ""key"", ""indicator"", ""assessment"", ""immigrant"", ""health"", ""however"", ""evidence"", ""impact"", ""srh"", ""generational"", ""status"", ""duration"", ""residence"", ""we"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""se"", ""among"", ""immigrant"", ""offspre"", ""limited"", ""inconsistent"", ""overcome"", ""limitation"", ""existing"", ""research"", ""topic"", ""use"", ""uniquely"", ""large"", ""diverse"", ""datum"", ""source"", ""march"", ""annual"", ""social"", ""economic"", ""supplement"", ""current"", ""population"", ""survey"", ""cps"", ""2003"", ""2007"", ""n"", ""637"", ""209"", ""result"", ""able"", ""disaggregate"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""account"", ""country"", ""origin"", ""consider"", ""role"", ""multiple"", ""dimension"", ""se"", ""find"", ""overall"", ""first"", ""generation"", ""immigrant"", ""we"", ""low"", ""odd"", ""poor"", ""fair"", ""srh"", ""compare"", ""third"", ""generation"", ""association"", ""particularly"", ""strong"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""among"", ""first"", ""generation"", ""asian"", ""hispanic"", ""long"", ""duration"", ""residence"", ""positively"", ""associate"", ""poor"", ""fair"", ""srh"", ""finally"", ""socioeconomic"", ""gradient"", ""srh"", ""tend"", ""less"", ""pronounced"", ""among"", ""first"", ""generation"", ""versus"", ""third"", ""within"", ""first"", ""generation"", ""among"", ""recent"", ""arrival"", ""versus"", ""long"", ""duration"", ""highlight"", ""importance"", ""explicitly"", ""account"", ""multiple"", ""immigration"", ""related"", ""variable"", ""interaction"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""se"", ""otherwise"", ""study"", ""may"", ""misestimate"", ""srh"", ""difference"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""continue"", ""growth"", ""we"", ""immigrant"", ""population"", ""second"", ""generation"", ""underscore"", ""need"", ""examine"", ""pattern"", ""immigrant"", ""health"", ""systematically""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,"Asian, Hispanic"

"Absence of bias in clinician ratings of everyday functioning among African American, Hispanic and Caucasian patients with schizophrenia.","A substantial research literature implicates potential racial/ethnic bias in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and in clinical ratings of psychosis. There is no similar information regarding bias effects on ratings of everyday functioning. Our aims were to determine if Caucasian raters vary in their ratings of the everyday functioning of schizophrenia patients of different ethnicities, to find out which factors determine accurate self-report of everyday functioning in different ethnic groups, and to know if depression has similar effects on the way people of different ethnicities self-report their current functionality. We analyzed data on 295 patients with schizophrenia who provided their self-report of their everyday functioning and also had a Caucasian clinician rating their functionality. Three racial/ethnic groups (African American (AA), Hispanic and Caucasian) were studied and analyzed on the basis of neurocognition, functional capacity, depression and real-world functional outcomes. No differences based on racial/ethnic status in clinician assessments of patients' functionality were found. Differences between racial groups were found in personal and maternal levels of education. Severity of depression was significantly correlated with accuracy of self-assessment of functioning in Caucasians, but not in AAs. Higher scores on neurocognition and functional capacity scales correlated with reduced overestimation of functioning in AAs, but not in Hispanics.

"Indigency, ethnicity, and hospital viability. The growth of racially diverse communities challenges Catholic providers and sponsors.","A Catholic Health Association study analyzes correlations between the ethnic and racial composition of communities served by Catholic hospitals and these hospitals' viability and capacity to serve their communities. It also describes the extent to which Catholic hospitals serve racially homogeneous communities, on the one hand, and racially and ethnically diverse communities, on the other. For comparison, the study focuses on hospitals in two groups. Group A consists of hospitals in the top quartile based on their proportion of care for the poor and top-quartile percentages of black and Hispanic residents in their local communities. Group B consists of hospitals with bottom-quartile levels of care for the poor and bottom-quartile percentages of black and Hispanic residents. The study found that, from 1985 to 1990, group A hospitals continued to provide high levels of care for the poor (between 28 percent and 32 percent on average) while average margins fell from about 4 percent to below 1 percent. During the same period, the amount of care group B hospitals provided to the poor remained between 5 percent and 6 percent; although their margins declined, these hospitals were significantly more profitable than group A hospitals. The financial stress currently being experienced by many hospitals that serve communities with relatively high percentages of ethnic and racial minorities is troubling. Without basic reform of the healthcare system, many of these facilities may have to close, leaving many in their communities without access to adequate healthcare.","Health progress (Saint Louis, Mo.)","[""catholic"", ""health"", ""association"", ""analyze"", ""correlation"", ""ethnic"", ""racial"", ""composition"", ""community"", ""serve"", ""catholic"", ""hospital"", ""hospital"", ""viability"", ""capacity"", ""serve"", ""community"", ""also"", ""describe"", ""extent"", ""catholic"", ""hospital"", ""serve"", ""racially"", ""homogeneous"", ""community"", ""one"", ""hand"", ""racially"", ""ethnically"", ""diverse"", ""community"", ""comparison"", ""focus"", ""hospital"", ""two"", ""group"", ""group"", ""consist"", ""hospital"", ""top"", ""quartile"", ""base"", ""proportion"", ""care"", ""poor"", ""top"", ""quartile"", ""percentage"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""resident"", ""local"", ""community"", ""group"", ""b"", ""consist"", ""hospital"", ""bottom"", ""quartile"", ""level"", ""care"", ""poor"", ""bottom"", ""quartile"", ""percentage"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""resident"", ""find"", ""1985"", ""1990"", ""group"", ""hospital"", ""continue"", ""provide"", ""high"", ""level"", ""care"", ""poor"", ""28"", ""percent"", ""32"", ""percent"", ""average"", ""average"", ""margin"", ""fall"", ""4"", ""percent"", ""1"", ""percent"", ""period"", ""amount"", ""care"", ""group"", ""b"", ""hospital"", ""provide"", ""poor"", ""remain"", ""5"", ""percent"", ""6"", ""percent"", ""although"", ""margin"", ""decline"", ""hospital"", ""significantly"", ""profitable"", ""group"", ""hospital"", ""financial"", ""stress"", ""currently"", ""experience"", ""many"", ""hospital"", ""serve"", ""community"", ""relatively"", ""high"", ""percentage"", ""ethnic"", ""racial"", ""minority"", ""troubling"", ""without"", ""basic"", ""reform"", ""healthcare"", ""system"", ""many"", ""facility"", ""may"", ""close"", ""leave"", ""many"", ""community"", ""without"", ""access"", ""adequate"", ""healthcare""]",None,None,None,Hispanic

"Racial/Ethnic-Specific Reference Intervals for Common Laboratory Tests: A Comparison among Asians, Blacks, Hispanics, and White.","Reference intervals (RIs) for common clinical laboratory tests are usually not developed separately for different subpopulations.

This current study included 3,077 participants aged 18-65 years who reported their health status as ""Excellent,"" ""Very good,"" or ""Good,"" with known race/ethnicity as white, black, Hispanic, or Asian. Quantile regression analyses adjusted for sex were conducted to evaluate racial/ethnic differences in the normal ranges of 38 laboratory tests. Significant racial/ethnic differences were found in almost all laboratory tests. Compared to whites, the normal range for Asians significantly shifted to higher values in globulin and total protein and to lower values in creatinine, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin concentration, and mean platelet volume. These results indicate that racial/ethnic subpopulations have unique distributions in the labortoary tests and race/ethnicity may need to be incorporated in the development of their RIs.

The association of perceived discrimination with low back pain.,"A handful of recent studies have documented perceived discrimination as a correlate of poor physical and mental health status among ethnic and racial minority groups. To date, however, despite a proliferation of research on ethnic disparities in the severity and impact of a number of persistent pain conditions, there have been no reports on associations between perceived discrimination and pain-related symptoms. Using data from a national survey (the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States; MIDUS), we explore the relationships between perceived discriminatory events and the report of back pain among African-American and white men and women. As expected, African-American participants reported substantially greater perceptions of discrimination than white participants.

Among white participants, perceptions of discrimination were minimally related or unrelated to back pain.

Moving Towards a More Comprehensive Investigation of Racial/Ethnic Differences in Cognitive Disability Among US Adults.,"We examined racial/ethnic differences in cognitive disability and the contribution of sociodemographic factors to these differences. Using logistic regression, we measured the association between race/ethnicity and cognitive disability after adjustment for sociodemographic covariates, including agegroup, sex, education, nativity, region, marital status, and occupation among 2009 American Community Survey respondents (≥25 years). Effect modification was also explored. Cognitive disability was self-reported by 6 % of respondents. The proportion with cognitive disability was highest for Blacks and Native American/Pacific Islanders. Statistically significant effect modification was observed for all sociodemographic covariates, except sex. Although most sociodemographic modifiers revealed a more convoluted relationship between race/ethnicity and cognitive disability, the cognitive benefits of higher education, foreign born nativity, and top-tier occupations were observed among most racial/ethnic groups. The observed interplay between sociodemographics and race/ethnicity highlight a complex relationship between race/ethnicity and cognitive disability.

"Current diversity in orthopaedics. Issues of race, ethnicity, and gender.","The size and diversity of the United States orthopaedic workforce continues to interest academic graduate medical education analysts. Numerous medical groups have expressed the need for diversity in orthopaedics and in general medicine. The Association of American Medical Colleges has had two policies since the early 1970s concerning minorities in medicine. It was thought that special attention should be given to minority groups underrepresented in medicine and that the minority groups should be represented in medicine in the same proportion as in the population as a whole. The purpose of this paper was to examine the selection of orthopaedic residents during the past 12 years based on the candidates documented race, ethnicity, and gender. The diversity of orthopaedic residents changed minimally during the period of the study. The percentage of African American, Hispanic, Native American, Puerto Rican, and Mexican American orthopaedic residents essentially has remained unchanged. The percentage of Asian and Pacific Islander women has remained unchanged whereas the percentage of Asian and Pacific Islander men has quadrupled (2.2% in 1983 to 9.8% in 1995) during the 12 years of the study.

Racial/ethnic heterogeneity in the socioeconomic patterning of CVD risk factors: in the United States: the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis.,"Many studies document racial variation, gender differences, and socioeconomic status (SES) patterning in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors but few studies have investigated heterogeneity in SES differences by race/ethnicity or gender. Using data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (N=6,814) and stratified regression models, we investigated race/ethnic differences in the SES patterning of diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and body mass index (BMI). Inverse socioeconomic gradients in hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and BMI were observed in White and Black women but associations were weaker or absent in Hispanic and Chinese women (except in the case of diabetes for Hispanic women). Even greater heterogeneity in social patterning of risk factors was observed in men. In White men all four risk factors were inversely associated with socioeconomic position, although often associations were only present or were stronger for education than for income. The inverse socioeconomic patterning was much less consistent in men of other races/ethnic groups, and higher SES was associated with higher BMI in non-White men. These findings have implications for understanding the causes of social patterning, for the analysis of SES adjusted race/ethnic differences, and for the targeting of interventions.",Journal of health care for the poor and underserved,"[""many"", ""study"", ""document"", ""racial"", ""variation"", ""gender"", ""difference"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""ses"", ""pattern"", ""cardiovascular"", ""disease"", ""cvd"", ""risk"", ""factor"", ""study"", ""investigate"", ""heterogeneity"", ""se"", ""difference"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""gender"", ""use"", ""datum"", ""multi"", ""ethnic"", ""atherosclerosis"", ""n"", ""6"", ""814"", ""stratify"", ""regression"", ""model"", ""investigate"", ""race"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""se"", ""patterning"", ""diabetes"", ""hypertension"", ""smoking"", ""body"", ""mass"", ""index"", ""bmi"", ""inverse"", ""socioeconomic"", ""gradient"", ""hypertension"", ""diabete"", ""smoking"", ""bmi"", ""observe"", ""white"", ""black"", ""woman"", ""association"", ""weak"", ""absent"", ""hispanic"", ""chinese"", ""woman"", ""except"", ""case"", ""diabete"", ""hispanic"", ""woman"", ""even"", ""great"", ""heterogeneity"", ""social"", ""patterning"", ""risk"", ""factor"", ""observe"", ""man"", ""white"", ""man"", ""four"", ""risk"", ""factor"", ""inversely"", ""associate"", ""socioeconomic"", ""position"", ""although"", ""often"", ""association"", ""present"", ""strong"", ""education"", ""income"", ""inverse"", ""socioeconomic"", ""patterning"", ""much"", ""less"", ""consistent"", ""man"", ""race"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""high"", ""se"", ""associate"", ""high"", ""bmi"", ""non"", ""white"", ""man"", ""finding"", ""implication"", ""understanding"", ""cause"", ""social"", ""patterning"", ""analysis"", ""se"", ""adjust"", ""race"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""target"", ""intervention""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,"Black, Hispanic"

Is there a menopausal syndrome? Menopausal status and symptoms across racial/ethnic groups.,"In recent years, research on menopausal symptomalogy has focused on identifying symptom groupings experienced by women as they progress from premenopausal to postmenopausal status. However, most of these studies have been conducted among Caucasian women from western cultures. This leaves open the question of whether the findings from these studies can be extended to women of other racial/ethnic groups or cultures. Furthermore, many of the previous studies have been conducted on relatively small samples. This paper addresses the diversity of the menopause experience by comparing symptom reporting in a large cross-sectional survey of women aged 40-55 years among racial/ethnic groups of women in the United States (Caucasian, African-American, Chinese, Japanese, and Hispanic). Evaluation of the extent to which symptoms group together and consistently relate to menopausal status across these five samples provides evidence for or against a universal menopausal syndrome. The specific research questions addressed in this paper are: (1) How does the factor structure of symptoms among mid-aged women compare across racial/ethnic groups? (2) Is symptom reporting related to race/ethnicity or menopausal status? and (3) Does the relation between menopausal status and symptoms vary across racial/ethnic groups? Analyses are based on 14,906 women who participated in the multi-ethnic, multi-race, multi-site study of mid-aged women called the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). Study participants completed a 15-min telephone or in-person interview that contained questions on a variety of health-related topics. Items of interest for these analyses include symptoms, menstrual history (to assess menopausal status), health status, and sociodemographics. Factor analysis results showed that across all five racial/ethnic groups, two consistent factors emerged; one consisting of clearly menopausal symptoms -- hot flashes and night sweats -- and the other consisting of psychological and psychosomatic symptoms. Results of regression analyses showed racial/ethnic differences in symptom reporting, as well as differences by menopausal status. Controlling for age, education, health, and economic strain, Caucasian women reported significantly more psychosomatic symptoms than other racial/ethnic groups. African-American women reported significantly more vasomotor symptoms. Perimenopausal women, hormone users, and women who had a surgical menopause reported significantly more vasomotor symptoms. All of these groups, plus postmenopausal women, reported significantly more vasomotor symptoms than premenopausal women. The pattern of results argues against a universal menopausal syndrome consisting of a variety of vasomotor and psychological symptoms.",Social science & medicine (1982),"[""recent"", ""year"", ""research"", ""menopausal"", ""symptomalogy"", ""focus"", ""identify"", ""symptom"", ""grouping"", ""experience"", ""woman"", ""progress"", ""premenopausal"", ""postmenopausal"", ""status"", ""however"", ""study"", ""conduct"", ""among"", ""caucasian"", ""woman"", ""western"", ""culture"", ""leave"", ""open"", ""question"", ""whether"", ""finding"", ""study"", ""extend"", ""woman"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""culture"", ""furthermore"", ""many"", ""previous"", ""study"", ""conduct"", ""relatively"", ""small"", ""sample"", ""paper"", ""address"", ""diversity"", ""menopause"", ""experience"", ""compare"", ""symptom"", ""report"", ""large"", ""cross"", ""sectional"", ""survey"", ""woman"", ""aged"", ""40"", ""55"", ""year"", ""among"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""woman"", ""unite"", ""state"", ""caucasian"", ""african"", ""american"", ""chinese"", ""japanese"", ""hispanic"", ""evaluation"", ""extent"", ""symptom"", ""group"", ""together"", ""consistently"", ""relate"", ""menopausal"", ""status"", ""across"", ""five"", ""sample"", ""provide"", ""evidence"", ""universal"", ""menopausal"", ""syndrome"", ""specific"", ""research"", ""question"", ""address"", ""paper"", ""1"", ""factor"", ""structure"", ""symptom"", ""among"", ""mid"", ""aged"", ""woman"", ""compare"", ""across"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""2"", ""symptom"", ""report"", ""related"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""menopausal"", ""status"", ""3"", ""relation"", ""menopausal"", ""status"", ""symptom"", ""vary"", ""across"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""analysis"", ""base"", ""14"", ""906"", ""woman"", ""participate"", ""multi"", ""ethnic"", ""multi"", ""race"", ""multi"", ""site"", ""mid"", ""aged"", ""woman"", ""call"", ""woman"", ""health"", ""across"", ""nation"", ""swan"", ""participant"", ""complete"", ""15"", ""min"", ""telephone"", ""person"", ""interview"", ""contain"", ""question"", ""variety"", ""health"", ""related"", ""topic"", ""item"", ""interest"", ""analysis"", ""include"", ""symptom"", ""menstrual"", ""history"", ""assess"", ""menopausal"", ""status"", ""health"", ""status"", ""sociodemographics"", ""factor"", ""analysis"", ""show"", ""across"", ""five"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""two"", ""consistent"", ""factor"", ""emerge"", ""one"", ""consist"", ""clearly"", ""menopausal"", ""symptom"", ""hot"", ""flash"", ""night"", ""sweat"", ""consist"", ""psychological"", ""psychosomatic"", ""symptom"", ""regression"", ""analysis"", ""show"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""symptom"", ""report"", ""well"", ""difference"", ""menopausal"", ""status"", ""control"", ""age"", ""education"", ""health"", ""economic"", ""strain"", ""caucasian"", ""woman"", ""report"", ""significantly"", ""psychosomatic"", ""symptom"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""african"", ""american"", ""woman"", ""report"", ""significantly"", ""vasomotor"", ""symptom"", ""perimenopausal"", ""woman"", ""hormone"", ""user"", ""woman"", ""surgical"", ""menopause"", ""report"", ""significantly"", ""vasomotor"", ""symptom"", ""group"", ""plus"", ""postmenopausal"", ""woman"", ""report"", ""significantly"", ""vasomotor"", ""symptom"", ""premenopausal"", ""woman"", ""pattern"", ""argue"", ""universal"", ""menopausal"", ""syndrome"", ""consist"", ""variety"", ""vasomotor"", ""psychological"", ""symptom""]",None,None,None,"Caucasian, Hispanic"

They apply four measures of relative disparity and three measures of absolute disparity to trends in US lung cancer incidence by area-socioeconomic position and race-ethnicity from 1992 to 2004. Among females, measures of absolute and relative disparity suggested that area-socioeconomic and race-ethnic disparities increased over these 12 years but differed widely with respect to the magnitude of the change. Among males, the authors found substantial disagreement among summary measures of relative disparity with respect to the magnitude and the direction of change in disparities. Among area-socioeconomic groups, the index of disparity increased by 47% and the relative concentration index decreased by 116%, while for race-ethnicity the index of disparity increased by 36% and the Theil index increased by 13%. The choice of a summary measure of disparity may affect the interpretation of changes in health disparities.

"Getting them enrolled is only half the battle: college success as a function of race or ethnicity, gender, and class.","This study examines the gender and racial or ethnic gaps in college grades and graduation of a 1999 freshman cohort of students attending 24 selective predominantly White institutions (PWIs) and the factors that account for observed gaps. The study is guided by the question of whether gender, race or ethnicity, and socioeconomic status combine to affect college outcomes or whether they interact so that outcomes are more positive or adverse for one group than another. Gender gaps were observed for Black and Latino students. For Black students, the gender gap in degree attainment widened once sociodemographic factors were considered. In contrast, the gender gap for Latino students narrowed and became insignificant when sociodemographics were controlled. Additional within-group interactions were also evident. For example, the 6-year college graduation rates were higher for Black females than for males whose mothers did not have college degrees, but no gender gap existed when the mother had a college degree.

"Racial and ethnic inequality in the United States, 1940 and 1950: the impact of geographic location and human capital.","""This article examines the trend in ethnic stratification from 1940 to 1950, a decade that has been viewed as a critical turning point in race and ethnic relations in the United States.... It begins with a brief overview of ethnic diversity in the United States and a descriptive account of ethnic differentiation and inequality. Then it tests--in a preliminary fashion--several hypotheses about the role of socioeconomic and geographical forces in shaping ethnic occupational inequality across this significant interval of American history. Based upon an analysis of the newly released Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files of the 1940 and 1950 Population Censuses, the study concludes that racial minorities and Hispanics experienced a qualitatively different occupational attainment process than did men in the white majority and white ethnic populations.""

The Costly Consequences of not Being Socially and Behaviorally Ready to Learn by Kindergarten in Baltimore City.,"Social, emotional, and behavioral skills are foundational to learning and long-term success. However, poverty and exposure to adverse childhood experiences reduce the chances of children entering kindergarten socially-behaviorally ready to learn. This study examined the unique impact of 5-year-old children (N = 11,412) entering kindergarten not socially-behaviorally ready on three costly school outcomes by fourth grade in Baltimore City Public Schools: being retained in grade, receiving services and supports through an IEP or 504 plan, and being suspended/expelled. Controlling for all other types of school readiness, students not identified as socially-behaviorally ready for kindergarten were more likely to experience all three school outcomes.

Trends in exposure to industrial air toxins for different racial and socioeconomic groups: A spatial and temporal examination of environmental inequality in the U.S. from 1995 to 2004.,"In recent decades there have been dramatic declines in industrial air toxins. However, there has yet to be a national study investigating if the drop has mitigated the unequal exposure to industrial toxins by race and social class. This paper addresses this by developing a unique dataset of air pollution exposure estimates, by aggregating the annual fall-out location of 415 air toxins, from 17,604 facilities, for the years 1995 to 2004 up to census block groups (N=216,159/year). These annual estimates of exposure were matched with census data to calculate trends in exposure for different racial and socioeconomic groups. Results show that exposure to air toxins has decreased for everyone, but African-Americans are consistently more exposed than Whites and Hispanics and socioeconomic status is not as protective for African-Americans. These results by race were further explored using spatially specified multilevel models which examine trends over time and across institutional boundaries.",Social science research,"[""recent"", ""decade"", ""dramatic"", ""decline"", ""industrial"", ""air"", ""toxin"", ""however"", ""yet"", ""national"", ""investigate"", ""drop"", ""mitigate"", ""unequal"", ""exposure"", ""industrial"", ""toxin"", ""race"", ""social"", ""class"", ""paper"", ""address"", ""develop"", ""unique"", ""dataset"", ""air"", ""pollution"", ""exposure"", ""estimate"", ""aggregate"", ""annual"", ""fall"", ""location"", ""415"", ""air"", ""toxin"", ""17"", ""604"", ""facility"", ""year"", ""1995"", ""2004"", ""census"", ""block"", ""group"", ""n"", ""216"", ""159"", ""year"", ""annual"", ""estimate"", ""exposure"", ""match"", ""census"", ""datum"", ""calculate"", ""trend"", ""exposure"", ""different"", ""racial"", ""socioeconomic"", ""group"", ""show"", ""exposure"", ""air"", ""toxin"", ""decrease"", ""everyone"", ""african"", ""american"", ""consistently"", ""expose"", ""white"", ""hispanic"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""protective"", ""african"", ""americans"", ""race"", ""explore"", ""use"", ""spatially"", ""specify"", ""multilevel"", ""model"", ""examine"", ""trend"", ""time"", ""across"", ""institutional"", ""boundary""]",None,None,"socioeconomic status, social class",Hispanic
"Recruitment, retention and matriculation of ethnic minority nursing students: a University of Mississippi School of Nursing approach.","According to Bednash (2000), the future of health care pivots on an adequate supply of appropriately educated and skilled professional registered nurses. Recognizing the long history of and the struggles by African-American (AA) nurses for education and equality in the nursing profession, it is essential that more African-American students be recruited, retained, and matriculated into the profession of nursing. African-American nurses have always contributed to the care of the poor and the sick and played a decisive role in the improvement of the health of their communities. The Bureau of Health Professions Division of nursing (March 2000) reported that 86.6 percent of the registered nurse population were white while 12.3 percent represented racial and ethnic minority groups. Given the current racial/ethnic background of the registered nurse population in the United States, there is an obvious disparity in the representation of minorities in the nursing profession, in spite of the increasing number of minorities represented in the general population. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to document strategies that are used to actively recruit, retain, and graduate ethnic minority students from the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) School of Nursing (SON).",Journal of cultural diversity,"[""accord"", ""bednash"", ""2000"", ""future"", ""health"", ""care"", ""pivot"", ""adequate"", ""supply"", ""appropriately"", ""educate"", ""skilled"", ""professional"", ""register"", ""nurse"", ""recognize"", ""long"", ""history"", ""struggle"", ""african"", ""american"", ""aa"", ""nurse"", ""education"", ""equality"", ""nursing"", ""profession"", ""essential"", ""african"", ""american"", ""student"", ""recruit"", ""retain"", ""matriculated"", ""profession"", ""nursing"", ""african"", ""american"", ""nurse"", ""always"", ""contribute"", ""care"", ""poor"", ""sick"", ""play"", ""decisive"", ""role"", ""improvement"", ""health"", ""community"", ""bureau"", ""health"", ""profession"", ""division"", ""nursing"", ""march"", ""2000"", ""report"", ""86"", ""6"", ""percent"", ""register"", ""nurse"", ""population"", ""white"", ""12"", ""3"", ""percent"", ""represent"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""group"", ""give"", ""current"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""background"", ""register"", ""nurse"", ""population"", ""united"", ""state"", ""obvious"", ""disparity"", ""representation"", ""minority"", ""nursing"", ""profession"", ""spite"", ""increase"", ""number"", ""minority"", ""represent"", ""general"", ""population"", ""thus"", ""purpose"", ""paper"", ""document"", ""strategy"", ""use"", ""actively"", ""recruit"", ""retain"", ""graduate"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""student"", ""university"", ""mississippi"", ""medical"", ""center"", ""ummc"", ""school"", ""nursing"", ""son""]",None,None,None,None

Examining the inclusion of diverse participants in cognitive behavior therapy research for youth with autism spectrum disorder and anxiety.,"Results of randomized controlled trials have demonstrated significant reductions in anxiety symptoms following cognitive behavior therapy participation. Although promising, the extent to which previous research has included families from low socioeconomic status or racially/ethnically diverse backgrounds is unknown. Aims of this study are as follows: (1) What is the race, ethnicity, and educational attainment of youth with autism spectrum disorder and their families who have participated in research examining the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy for anxiety? and (2) How do the demographics of these participants compare to that of the United States census? A total of 14 studies were reviewed that included 473 participants. Chi-square analyses indicated that there are significant differences between the race/ethnicity of youth with autism spectrum disorder participating in cognitive behavior therapy research for anxiety and that of youth in the United States. Standard residuals indicated significant overrepresentation of White youth and significant underrepresentation of Black and Latino youth in cognitive behavior therapy research (all p-values <0.001). Similarly, there were significant differences in the educational attainment of caregivers participating in cognitive behavior therapy research, with a significant underrepresentation of caregivers from low socioeconomic status backgrounds ( p < 0.001).

Urban poverty and infant mortality rate disparities.,"This study examined whether the relationship between high poverty and infant mortality rates (IMRs) varied across race- and ethnic-specific populations in large urban areas. Data were drawn from 1990 Census and 1992-1994 Vital Statistics for selected U.S. metropolitan areas. High-poverty areas were defined as neighborhoods in which > or = 40% of the families had incomes below the federal poverty threshold. Bivariate models showed that high poverty was a significant predictor of IMR for each group; however, multivariate analyses demonstrate that maternal health and regional factors explained most of the variance in the group-specific models of IMR. Additional analysis revealed that high poverty was significantly associated with minority-white IMR disparities, and country of origin is an important consideration for ethnic birth outcomes.

"Explaining US racial/ethnic disparities in health declines and mortality in late middle age: the roles of socioeconomic status, health behaviors, and health insurance.","Pervasive health disparities continue to exist among racial/ethnic minority groups, but the factors related to these disparities have not been fully elucidated. We undertook this prospective cohort study to determine the independent contributions of socioeconomic status (SES), health behaviors, and health insurance in explaining racial/ethnic disparities in mortality and health declines. Our study period was 1992-1998, and our study population consists of a US nationally representative sample of 6286 non-Hispanic whites (W), 1391 non-Hispanic blacks (B), 405 Hispanics interviewed in English (H/E), and 318 Hispanics interviewed in Spanish (H/S), ages 51-61 in 1992 in the Health and Retirement Study. The main outcome measures were death; major decline in self-reported overall health (SROH); and combined outcome of death or major decline in SROH. Crude mortality rates over the 6-year study period for W, B, H/E and H/S were 5.8%, 10.6%, 5.8%, and 4.4%, respectively. Rates of major decline in SROH were 14.6%, 23.2%, 22.1% and 39.4%, for W, B, H/E and H/S, respectively. Higher mortality rates for B versus W were mostly explained by worse baseline health.

The Association of Racial and Ethnic Social Networks with Mental Health Service Utilization Across Minority Groups in the USA.,"Though they have comparable prevalence of mental illness, American racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to receive mental health services than white Americans. Minorities are often part of racial and ethnic social networks, which may affect mental health service utilization in two ways. While these networks can encourage service utilization by working as a channel of knowledge spillover and social support, they can also discourage utilization by stigmatizing mental illness. This study examined the association of racial and ethnic social networks with mental health service utilization and depression diagnosis in the USA. Using the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data, a multilevel mixed-effect generalized linear model was adopted, controlling for predisposing, need, and enabling factors of mental health service utilization. The association of racial and ethnic social networks with mental health service utilization and depression diagnosis was significant and negative among African Americans. Despite having a comparable number of bad mental health days, the association was insignificant among Hispanic, Asian, and non-Hispanic white respondents. An African American living in a county where all residents were African American was less likely to utilize mental health services by 84.3-86.8% and less likely to be diagnosed with depression by 76.0-84.8% than an African American living in a county where no residents were African American. These results suggest racial and ethnic social networks can discourage mental health service utilization and should be engaged in efforts to improve mental health, particularly among African American communities in the USA.",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,"[""though"", ""comparable"", ""prevalence"", ""mental"", ""illness"", ""american"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""less"", ""likely"", ""receive"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""service"", ""white"", ""american"", ""minority"", ""often"", ""part"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""social"", ""network"", ""may"", ""affect"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""service"", ""utilization"", ""two"", ""way"", ""network"", ""encourage"", ""service"", ""utilization"", ""working"", ""channel"", ""knowledge"", ""spillover"", ""social"", ""support"", ""also"", ""discourage"", ""utilization"", ""stigmatizing"", ""mental"", ""illness"", ""examine"", ""association"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""social"", ""network"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""service"", ""utilization"", ""depression"", ""diagnosis"", ""usa"", ""use"", ""2012"", ""behavioral"", ""risk"", ""factor"", ""surveillance"", ""system"", ""brfss"", ""datum"", ""multilevel"", ""mixed"", ""effect"", ""generalize"", ""linear"", ""model"", ""adopt"", ""control"", ""predispose"", ""need"", ""enable"", ""factor"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""service"", ""utilization"", ""association"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""social"", ""network"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""service"", ""utilization"", ""depression"", ""diagnosis"", ""negative"", ""among"", ""african"", ""american"", ""despite"", ""comparable"", ""number"", ""bad"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""day"", ""association"", ""insignificant"", ""among"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""respondent"", ""african"", ""american"", ""live"", ""county"", ""resident"", ""african"", ""american"", ""less"", ""likely"", ""utilize"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""service"", ""84"", ""3"", ""86"", ""8"", ""less"", ""likely"", ""diagnose"", ""depression"", ""76"", ""0"", ""84"", ""8"", ""african"", ""american"", ""live"", ""county"", ""resident"", ""african"", ""american"", ""suggest"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""social"", ""network"", ""discourage"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""service"", ""utilization"", ""engage"", ""effort"", ""improve"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""particularly"", ""among"", ""african"", ""american"", ""community"", ""usa""]",depression,None,None,"Asian, Hispanic"

Racial and ethnic disparities in educational achievement and aspirations: findings from a statewide survey from 1998 to 2010.,"Educational achievement and attainment are associated with health outcomes across the entire life span. The objective of this study was to determine whether racial/ethnic disparities in academic achievement and educational aspirations have changed over time. The study used data from the Minnesota Student Survey (MSS) from 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010. The MSS is administered to adolescents in public secondary schools, charter schools, and tribal schools. Measures of academic achievement and educational aspirations were examined by race/ethnicity, poverty status, and family structure. Chi square tests evaluated differences in the above proportions. The analytic sample included 351,510 adolescents (1998, N = 67,239; 2001, N = 69,177; 2004, N = 71,084; 2007, N = 72,312; and 2010, N = 71,698). Study participants ranged in age from 13 to 19 years (mean = 15.9, SD = 1.6). Most were white (81.7 %), followed by 5.4 % Asian American/Pacific Islander, 4.3 % Black/African American, 2.7 % Hispanic/Latino, 1 % American Indian, and 4.9 % mixed race. Results showed that academic achievement fluctuated amongst all the racial/ethnic groups, but there were significant race/ethnic disparities at every time point. Overall, academic aspirations increased over time among the adolescents. Poverty was associated with poorer academic indicators for white youth, but not consistently for other racial/ethnic groups of youth. Family structure, however, was significantly associated with the educational indicators across all racial and ethnic groups. Despite many efforts to improve educational outcomes, there remain significant disparities in educational achievement and aspirations related to race-ethnicity and social status.

Using Allostatic Load to Validate Self-rated Health for Racial/Ethnic Groups in the United States.,"This study evaluates the validity of subjective health measurement for racial/ethnic comparisons in the United States, by assessing whether allostatic load (AL) is equally associated with poor/fair self-rated health (SRH) for different racial/ethnic groups. This study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) for 2006-2010. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit and stratified by race/ethnicity to study the association between AL and poor/fair SRH. Higher levels of AL were associated with higher odds of reporting poor/fair SRH. However, this association differs by race/ethnicity. Analysis of interactions and racial/ethnic-stratified models suggest that AL is less associated with poor/fair SRH status for non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics populations. These results demonstrate that subjective health ratings potentially underestimate actual measures of biological health risk, especially for racial/ethnic minorities.

Cultural and gender differences in emotion regulation: relation to depression.,"In the last decade, studies have shown that the use of specific emotion regulation strategies contributes to an increased risk for depression. Past research, however, has overlooked potential cultural and gender differences in emotion regulation. The present study examined the relation between the use of emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptoms among college students in two different cultures (n=380 in Seoul, Korea; n=384 in Miami, USA). Koreans, compared with American students, reported more frequent use of brooding, whereas Americans reported more anger suppression than Koreans. Women were more likely than men to use both types of rumination (i.e., reflective pondering and brooding) and anger suppression in both countries, but these gender differences disappeared once levels of depressive symptoms were controlled for. In addition, the association between the use of reappraisal and depressive symptoms was significantly stronger in the Korean compared to the US sample. In contrast, the association between anger suppression and depressive symptoms was significantly stronger in the American compared to the Korean sample.

"Sociopolitical development, work salience, and vocational expectations among low socioeconomic status African American, Latin American, and Asian American youth.","Structural barriers constrain marginalized youths' development of work salience and vocational expectations. Sociopolitical development (SPD), the consciousness of, and motivation to reduce, sociopolitical inequality, may facilitate the negotiation of structural constraints. A structural model of SPD's impact on work salience and vocational expectations was proposed and its generalizability tested among samples of low-socioeconomic-status African American, Latin American, and Asian American youth, with Educational Longitudinal Study data. Measurement and temporal invariance of these constructs was first established before testing the proposed model across the samples. Across the three samples, 10th-grade SPD had significant effects on 10th-grade work salience and vocational expectations; 12th-grade SPD had a significant effect on 12th-grade work salience.

Students' Motivation and Engagement Predict Reading Achievement Differently by Ethnic Group.,"The authors examined Grade 3 and Grade 5 teacher-rated classroom engagement and student self-reported motivation for reading as predictors of reading achievement. They investigated the patterns of prediction of achievement for three racial/ethnic groups (White, Black, and Hispanic) and five levels of socioeconomic status (SES) in a combined within-group model. Groups were created by crossing race/ethnicity with SES to form 15 independent groups for each grade level. Results indicated that self-reported motivation was a significant predictor of reading achievement mainly for White third-grade students; teacher-reported engagement was a better predictor for all racial/ethnic groups for both Grade 3 and Grade 5 reading achievement.

The Links Between Youth Employment and Educational Attainment Across Racial Groups.,"Research suggests that the relations between adolescent employment and youth development vary by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity. However, it is unclear whether the links between paid work and college outcomes vary by either SES or race/ethnicity, or both. Using data from the Educational Longitudinal Study, we find that low-intensity work during high school is associated with positive college outcomes for almost all students, whereas the associations between high-intensity work and negative postsecondary outcomes are mostly limited to White students.

The relationships of multiple factors to menopausal symptoms in different racial/ethnic groups of midlife women: The structural equation modeling.,"The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationships of multiple factors to menopausal symptoms in different racial/ethnic groups of midlife women. This secondary analysis was conducted with the data from 980 midlife women that were collected from 2005 to 2013 using the Midlife Women's Symptom Index. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The model had the highest fit indices for non-Hispanic (NH) White midlife women, and prominent racial/ethnic differences were observed in the relationships of multiple factors to menopausal symptoms. In all racial/ethnic groups (except in Hispanic women), perceived health status was significantly positively associated with menopausal symptoms (<i>β</i> = -0.149 for NH African-American; <i>β</i> = -0.207 for NH Asians; <i>β</i> = -0.162 for NH Whites). Body mass index was significantly positively associated with menopausal symptoms only in NH Asians (<i>β</i> = 0.118) and Hispanics (<i>β</i> = 0.210). The racial/ethnic differences in the relationships of multiple factors to menopausal symptoms could have resulted from the different cultural contexts in which women undergo during their menopausal transitions.

"Ethnic differences in smoking rate, nicotine dependence, and cessation-related variables among adult smokers in Hawaii.","This study tests hypotheses concerning ethnic disparities in daily cigarette smoking rates, nicotine dependence, cessation motivation, and knowledge and past use of cessation methods (e.g., counseling) and products (e.g., nicotine patch) in a multiethnic sample of smokers in Hawaii. Previous research has revealed significant differences in smoking prevalence among Native Hawaiians, Filipinos, Japanese, and Caucasians in Hawaii. However, no study has examined differences in dependence and cessation-related knowledge and practices among smokers representing these ethnic groups. Participants were recruited through newspaper advertisement as part of a larger smoking cessation intervention study. Participants (N = 919; M age = 45.6, SD = 12.7; 48 % women) eligible to participate provided self-report data through mail and telephone. Participants included 271 self-identified Native Hawaiians, 63 Filipinos, 316 Caucasians, 145 ""East Asians"" (e.g., Japanese, Chinese), and 124 ""other"" (e.g., Hispanic, African-American). Pair-wise comparisons of means, controlling for age, gender, income, education, and marital status, indicated that Native Hawaiian smokers reported significantly higher daily smoking rates and higher levels of nicotine dependence compared to East Asians. Native Hawaiian smokers reported significantly lower motivation to quit smoking than Caucasians. Further, Filipino and Native Hawaiian smokers reported lesser knowledge of cessation methods and products, and less frequent use of these methods and products than Caucasians. The results suggest that Native Hawaiian and Filipino smokers could be underserved with regard to receiving cessation-related advice, and may lack adequate access to smoking cessation products and services. In addition, cessation interventions tailored for Native Hawaiian smokers could benefit from a motivational enhancement component.",Journal of community health,"[""test"", ""hypothesis"", ""concern"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""daily"", ""cigarette"", ""smoking"", ""rate"", ""nicotine"", ""dependence"", ""cessation"", ""motivation"", ""knowledge"", ""past"", ""use"", ""cessation"", ""method"", ""e"", ""g"", ""counseling"", ""product"", ""e"", ""g"", ""nicotine"", ""patch"", ""multiethnic"", ""sample"", ""smoker"", ""hawaii"", ""previous"", ""research"", ""reveal"", ""difference"", ""smoke"", ""prevalence"", ""among"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""filipinos"", ""japanese"", ""caucasian"", ""hawaii"", ""however"", ""examine"", ""difference"", ""dependence"", ""cessation"", ""related"", ""knowledge"", ""practice"", ""among"", ""smoker"", ""represent"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""participant"", ""recruit"", ""newspaper"", ""advertisement"", ""part"", ""large"", ""smoking"", ""cessation"", ""intervention"", ""participant"", ""n"", ""919"", ""age"", ""45"", ""6"", ""sd"", ""12"", ""7"", ""48"", ""woman"", ""eligible"", ""participate"", ""provide"", ""self"", ""report"", ""datum"", ""mail"", ""telephone"", ""participant"", ""include"", ""271"", ""self"", ""identify"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""63"", ""filipinos"", ""316"", ""caucasian"", ""145"", ""east"", ""asian"", ""e"", ""g"", ""japanese"", ""chinese"", ""124"", ""e"", ""g"", ""hispanic"", ""african"", ""american"", ""pair"", ""wise"", ""comparison"", ""mean"", ""control"", ""age"", ""gender"", ""income"", ""education"", ""marital"", ""status"", ""indicate"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""smoker"", ""report"", ""significantly"", ""high"", ""daily"", ""smoking"", ""rate"", ""high"", ""level"", ""nicotine"", ""dependence"", ""compare"", ""east"", ""asian"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""smoker"", ""report"", ""significantly"", ""low"", ""motivation"", ""quit"", ""smoke"", ""caucasian"", ""filipino"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""smoker"", ""report"", ""less"", ""knowledge"", ""cessation"", ""method"", ""product"", ""less"", ""frequent"", ""use"", ""method"", ""product"", ""caucasian"", ""suggest"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""filipino"", ""smoker"", ""could"", ""underserved"", ""regard"", ""receive"", ""cessation"", ""related"", ""advice"", ""may"", ""lack"", ""adequate"", ""access"", ""smoking"", ""cessation"", ""product"", ""service"", ""addition"", ""cessation"", ""intervention"", ""tailor"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""smoker"", ""could"", ""benefit"", ""motivational"", ""enhancement"", ""component""]",None,None,None,"Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic"
Two ecological models of academic achievement among diverse students with and without disabilities in transition.,"School experiences can have positive effects on student academic achievement, yet less is known about intermediary processes that contribute to these positive effects. We examined pathways between school experiences and academic achievement among 117 low-income urban students of color, many with disabilities, who transitioned to other schools following a school closure. Using structural equation modeling, we tested two ecological models that examined the relationships among self-reported school experiences, school support, academic self-efficacy, and school-reported academic achievement. The model in which the relationship between school experiences and academic achievement is mediated by both school support and academic self-efficacy, and that takes previous academic achievement into account, was an excellent fit with the data.

Using a nationally representative sample of AIAN, Hispanic, African American, and White children at school entry, the authors used latent growth models to estimate the associations among poverty, low parental education, living in a rural location, as well as child attitudes toward learning and internalizing/externalizing behaviors, with mathematical and reading cognitive skill development across the 1st 4 years of school. Results indicate that AIAN children entered kindergarten with scores on both mathematical and reading cognitive tests that were comparable to their peers from other ethnic groups of color. Importantly, all children who entered kindergarten with lower cognitive skill scores also acquired skills more slowly over the next 4 years. Having a positive approach to learning at the start of kindergarten was associated with cognitive skill levels at school entry nearly 1 standard deviation above the population average.

Intergenerational mobility in the post-1965 immigration era: estimates by an immigrant generation cohort method.,"The new second generation of the post-1965 immigration era is observed as children with their parents in 1980 and again as adults 25 years later. Intergenerational mobility is assessed for both men and women in four major racial/ethnic groups, both in regard to children's status attainment relative to parents and with regard to the rising societal standards proxied by native-born non-Hispanic whites. A profile of intergenerational mobility is prepared using multiple indicators of status attainment: high school and college completion, upper white-collar occupation, poverty, and homeownership. The immigrant generation cohort method we introduce accounts for four distinct temporal dimensions of immigrant progress, clarifying inconsistencies in the literature and highlighting differences in mobility between racial/ethnic groups and with respect to different outcome measures. The immigrant generation cohort method consistently finds greater intergenerational mobility than suggested by alternative approaches.

The Impact of Educational Attainment on Observed Race/Ethnic Disparities in Inflammatory Risk in the 2001-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.,"Inflammation has shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and growing evidence suggests Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHBs) and certain Hispanic subgroups have higher inflammation burden compared to Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). Socioeconomic status (SES) is a hypothesized pathway that may account for the higher inflammation burden for race/ethnic groups yet little is known about the biological processes by which SES ""gets under the skin"" to affect health and whether income and education have similar or distinct influences on elevated inflammation levels. The current study examines SES (income and education) associations with multiple levels of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), an important biomarker of inflammation, in a sample of 13,362 NHWs, 7696 NHBs and 4545 Mexican Americans (MAs) in the United States from the 2001 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. After adjusting for age, sex, and statin use, NHBs and MAs had higher intermediate and high CRP levels compared to NHWs. Income lessened the magnitude of the association for both race/ethnic groups. The greater intermediate and high CRP burden for NHBs and MAs was strongly explained by educational attainment. MAs were more vulnerable to high CRP levels for the lowest (i.e., less than nine years) and post high school (i.e., associates degree) educational levels. After additional adjustment for smoking, heavy drinking, high waist circumference, high blood pressure, diabetes and statin use, the strength of the association between race/ethnicity and inflammation was reduced for NHBs with elevated intermediate (RR = 1.31; p ≤ 0.001) and high CRP levels (RR = 1.14; p ≤ 0.001) compared to NHWs but the effect attenuated for MAs for both intermediate (RR = 0.74; p ≤ 0.001) and high CRP levels (RR = 0.38; p ≤ 0.001). These findings suggest educational attainment is a powerful predictor of elevated CRP levels in race/ethnic populations and challenges studies to move beyond examining income as a better predictor in the SES-inflammation pathway.",International journal of environmental research and public health,"[""inflammation"", ""show"", ""independent"", ""predictor"", ""cardiovascular"", ""disease"", ""cvd"", ""grow"", ""evidence"", ""suggest"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""black"", ""nhbs"", ""certain"", ""hispanic"", ""subgroup"", ""high"", ""inflammation"", ""burden"", ""compare"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""nhws"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""se"", ""hypothesize"", ""pathway"", ""may"", ""account"", ""high"", ""inflammation"", ""burden"", ""race"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""yet"", ""little"", ""known"", ""biological"", ""process"", ""se"", ""get"", ""skin"", ""affect"", ""health"", ""whether"", ""income"", ""education"", ""similar"", ""distinct"", ""influence"", ""elevated"", ""inflammation"", ""level"", ""current"", ""examine"", ""se"", ""income"", ""education"", ""association"", ""multiple"", ""level"", ""c"", ""reactive"", ""protein"", ""crp"", ""important"", ""biomarker"", ""inflammation"", ""sample"", ""13"", ""362"", ""nhws"", ""7696"", ""nhbs"", ""4545"", ""mexican"", ""american"", ""ma"", ""united"", ""state"", ""2001"", ""2008"", ""national"", ""health"", ""nutrition"", ""examination"", ""survey"", ""adjust"", ""age"", ""sex"", ""statin"", ""use"", ""nhbs"", ""ma"", ""high"", ""intermediate"", ""high"", ""crp"", ""level"", ""compare"", ""nhws"", ""income"", ""lessened"", ""magnitude"", ""association"", ""race"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""great"", ""intermediate"", ""high"", ""crp"", ""burden"", ""nhbs"", ""ma"", ""strongly"", ""explain"", ""educational"", ""attainment"", ""ma"", ""vulnerable"", ""high"", ""crp"", ""level"", ""low"", ""e"", ""less"", ""nine"", ""year"", ""post"", ""high"", ""school"", ""e"", ""associate"", ""degree"", ""educational"", ""level"", ""additional"", ""adjustment"", ""smoking"", ""heavy"", ""drinking"", ""high"", ""waist"", ""circumference"", ""high"", ""blood"", ""pressure"", ""diabete"", ""statin"", ""use"", ""strength"", ""association"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""inflammation"", ""reduce"", ""nhbs"", ""elevated"", ""intermediate"", ""rr"", ""1"", ""31"", ""p"", ""0"", ""001"", ""high"", ""crp"", ""level"", ""rr"", ""1"", ""14"", ""p"", ""0"", ""001"", ""compare"", ""nhws"", ""effect"", ""attenuate"", ""mas"", ""intermediate"", ""rr"", ""0"", ""74"", ""p"", ""0"", ""001"", ""high"", ""crp"", ""level"", ""rr"", ""0"", ""38"", ""p"", ""0"", ""001"", ""finding"", ""suggest"", ""educational"", ""attainment"", ""powerful"", ""predictor"", ""elevated"", ""crp"", ""level"", ""race"", ""ethnic"", ""population"", ""challenge"", ""study"", ""move"", ""beyond"", ""examine"", ""income"", ""well"", ""predictor"", ""ses"", ""inflammation"", ""pathway""]",None,None,None,"Black, Hispanic"

The influence of depressive symptoms on experimental smoking and intention to smoke in a diverse youth sample.,"Numerous studies have shown associations between smoking and depression, but the generalizability of the relationship across ethnic groups remains unknown. The present study assessed the association between depression and smoking intention and experimentation among adolescents from four ethnic groups in the Los Angeles area-Chinese/Chinese American, Latino/Hispanic, Persian/Iranian, and White. Over 800 7th graders in the Los Angeles area completed measures of depressive symptoms, experimentation with smoking, intention to smoke, and sociodemographic covariates. Chinese/Chinese American students had the lowest levels of depressive symptoms, whereas Latinos/Hispanics had the highest levels. Latinos/Hispanics also were the most likely to intend to smoke in the next year and were the most likely to have started experimenting with cigarette smoking. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with intention to smoke even after controlling for language use acculturation, socioeconomic status, gender, and ethnicity. The association between depressive symptoms and intention to smoke did not vary significantly across ethnic groups.

Racial and ethnic distribution of nonalcoholic fatty liver in persons with newly diagnosed chronic liver disease.,"We performed a cross-sectional study of newly diagnosed cases of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) identified between December 1998 and December 2000 in the Chronic Liver Disease Surveillance Study. We compared the demographic and clinical features of NAFLD in a racially diverse representative U.S. population (Alameda County, CA). Diagnostic criteria for probable NAFLD were persistent unexplained elevation of serum aminotransferase levels, radiology (ultrasound or computed tomography scan) consistent with fatty liver, and/or two or more of the following: (i) body mass index of 28 kg/m(2) or more, (ii) type 2 diabetes, or (iii) hyperlipidemia, in the absence of significant alcohol use. Definite NAFLD cases required histological confirmation. Of the 742 persons with newly diagnosed chronic liver disease, 159 (21.4%) had definite or probable NAFLD. The majority were nonwhite: Hispanics (28%), Asians (18%), African Americans (3%), and other race(s) (6%). African Americans with NAFLD were significantly older than other racial or ethnic groups (P < .001), and in Asians, NAFLD was 3.5 times more common in males than in females (P = .016). Clinical correlates of NAFLD (obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes) were similar among racial and ethnic groups, except that body mass index was lower in Asians compared with other groups (P < .001). Compared with the base population (Kaiser Permanente members), Hispanics with NAFLD were overrepresented (28% vs. 10%) and whites were underrepresented (45% vs. 59%). In conclusion, these racial and gender variations may reflect differences in genetic susceptibility to visceral adiposity, including hepatic involvement, and may have implications for the evaluation of persons with the metabolic syndrome.

Facilitators and barriers to use of the female condom: qualitative interviews with women of diverse ethnicity.,"Women in the United States, particularly African-Americans and Hispanics, are at increased risk for HIV. The female condom now offers women a potentially important option for HIV prevention, yet few efforts have been made to increase its use. To elucidate strategies to promote the use of the female condom, we conducted in-depth interviews with 62 women recruited from the four major racial/ethnic groups of the U.S. (African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic, and white). Subject recruitment took place at a family planning clinic in San Francisco during 1996-97. We identified four major types of facilitators and barriers to use of the female condom: mechanical, psychosexual, interpersonal, and situational. Specifically, the mechanical facilitators and barriers included positive and negative aspects of the device, and difficulty with insertion. The psychosexual factors were female empowerment, more options for contraception and disease prevention, discomfort with vaginal insertion, and condom use norms. The interpersonal factors included: enhanced communication, relationship status, partner preferences, and partner objections. Finally, the situations that made women disinclined to use the device were: no access to the female condom when having sex and using other forms of contraceptives.

Racial and Ethnic Variation in the Association of Social Integration with Mortality: Ten-year Prospective Population-based US Study.,"Substantial data link social relationships with mortality but few studies have examined whether these associations are consistent across racial and ethnic groups. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the presence and form of the social relationship/mortality association in a representative sample of US Black (n = 4,201), non-Hispanic White (n = 20,217) and Hispanic (n = 5,097) groups. In models adjusted for age, sex, chronic disease, socioeconomic status and smoking social integration was inversely related to ten-year survival in all groups. However, among Whites the association was linear and graded whereas among Blacks the association was linear but was statistically significant only for the highest level of social integration (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.66, 95% confidence interval = 0.47-0.94). A threshold pattern was observed among Hispanics, in that lower mortality risk was found for all social integration categories above the lowest level (HRs from 0.58 to 0.52, P's < 0.01) and each of the higher social integration categories were in turn equivalent. Received social support was unrelated to mortality across all groups. Higher social integration is associated with a survival advantage for Blacks and Whites.

Differences by race/ethnicity in older adults' beliefs about the relative importance of dietary supplements vs prescription medications: results from the SURE Study.,"Dietary supplement use is widespread among adults across races/ethnicities, yet reasons for use can vary across these groups. The Supplement Reporting (SURE) study quantified dietary supplement use and reasons for taking supplements in a multiethnic sample of adults who took at least one supplement. This study explored sociodemographic differences, including by race/ethnicity, associated with specific reasons/motivations for taking dietary supplements, including perceived importance of taking supplements relative to prescription medications. The study time period was March 2005 to August 2006. Participants (n=397) were older adults (ages 52 to 88 years) recruited from the Multiethnic Cohort Study in Hawaii and Los Angeles, CA, with equal representation of males and females from six ethnic groups (ie, white, Japanese American, Native Hawaiian, African American, US-born Latino, and foreign-born Latino). Subgroups of participants were compared by χ(2) tests and logistic regression. The most common reasons for taking supplements were to maintain a healthy life, because they were recommended by a health professional, and to prevent a disease/medical problem. A majority (76%) of participants reported that their dietary supplements were as important as prescription medications, with foreign-born Latinos and Japanese Americans being most likely to state this belief. The relative importance of supplements was not associated with excessive use, but 27% of participants exceeded the upper limit for a nutrient. It is crucial for health professionals to better understand why individuals take supplements and the importance that they attach to their use. This information could lead to better monitoring and education efforts to prevent overuse of supplements and possible interactions with medications.",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,"[""dietary"", ""supplement"", ""use"", ""widespread"", ""among"", ""adult"", ""across"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""yet"", ""reason"", ""use"", ""vary"", ""across"", ""group"", ""supplement"", ""reporting"", ""sure"", ""quantify"", ""dietary"", ""supplement"", ""use"", ""reason"", ""take"", ""supplement"", ""multiethnic"", ""sample"", ""adult"", ""take"", ""least"", ""one"", ""supplement"", ""explore"", ""sociodemographic"", ""difference"", ""include"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""associate"", ""specific"", ""reason"", ""motivation"", ""take"", ""dietary"", ""supplement"", ""include"", ""perceive"", ""importance"", ""take"", ""supplement"", ""relative"", ""prescription"", ""medication"", ""time"", ""period"", ""march"", ""2005"", ""august"", ""2006"", ""participant"", ""n"", ""397"", ""old"", ""adult"", ""age"", ""52"", ""88"", ""year"", ""recruit"", ""multiethnic"", ""cohort"", ""hawaii"", ""los"", ""angeles"", ""can"", ""equal"", ""representation"", ""male"", ""female"", ""six"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""ie"", ""white"", ""japanese"", ""american"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""african"", ""american"", ""we"", ""bear"", ""latino"", ""foreign"", ""bear"", ""latino"", ""subgroup"", ""participant"", ""compare"", ""\u03c7"", ""2"", ""test"", ""logistic"", ""regression"", ""common"", ""reason"", ""take"", ""supplement"", ""maintain"", ""healthy"", ""life"", ""recommend"", ""health"", ""professional"", ""prevent"", ""disease"", ""medical"", ""problem"", ""majority"", ""76"", ""participant"", ""report"", ""dietary"", ""supplement"", ""important"", ""prescription"", ""medication"", ""foreign"", ""bear"", ""latinos"", ""japanese"", ""american"", ""likely"", ""state"", ""belief"", ""relative"", ""importance"", ""supplement"", ""associate"", ""excessive"", ""use"", ""27"", ""participant"", ""exceed"", ""upper"", ""limit"", ""nutrient"", ""crucial"", ""health"", ""professional"", ""well"", ""understand"", ""individual"", ""take"", ""supplement"", ""importance"", ""attach"", ""use"", ""information"", ""could"", ""lead"", ""well"", ""monitoring"", ""education"", ""effort"", ""prevent"", ""overuse"", ""supplement"", ""possible"", ""interaction"", ""medication""]",None,None,None,Latino
Counseling utilization by ethnic minority college students.,"Although multicultural awareness in counseling has risen substantially in the last decade, little research has examined counseling utilization and outcomes for ethnic minorities on university campuses. A sample of 1,166 African American, Asian American, Caucasian, and Latino help-seeking university students from over 40 universities nationwide filled out the Outcome Questionnaire 45 (OQ45) at the first and last therapy sessions. Caucasian students attended significantly more sessions than all other groups.

Trends in the use of complementary and alternative medicine in the United States: 2002-2007.,"In this study we seek to assess recent trends in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use based on a comparative analysis of data from the 2002 and 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The findings suggest that CAM use, in particular the use of provider-based CAM therapies such as chiropractic care, massage, and acupuncture, have grown significantly in the U.S. This growth was more pronounced among non-Hispanic Whites than among racial and ethnic minorities, increasing an already existing White-minority gap in CAM use. Findings from this study also reveal that CAM use becomes more likely when access to conventional care has been restricted.

Ethnocultural differences in prevalence of adolescent depression.,"Data from an ethnically diverse sample of middle school (Grades 6-8) students (n = 5,423) are analyzed for ethnic differences in major depression. The point prevalence of major depression was 8.4% without and 4.3% with impairment. Data were sufficient to calculate prevalences for nine ethnic groups. Prevalences adjusted for impairment ranged from 1.9% for youths of Chinese descent to 6.6% for those of Mexican decent. African and Mexican American youths had significantly higher crude rates of depression without impairment, but only the latter had significantly higher rates of depression with impairment. Multivariate (logistic regression) analyses, adjusting for the effects of age, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES), yielded significant odds ratios for only one group. Mexican American youths were at elevated risk for both depression without (OR = 1.74, p < .05) and depression with impairment (OR = 1.71, p < .05). There was no significant interaction of ethnicity and SES in relation to depression. Females had higher prevalences of depression with and without impairment, as did youths who reported that their SES was somewhat or much worse off than their peers.

Additionally, we tested whether relationship outcomes varied based on the delivery format (i.e., group format vs. couple format). The sample included 321 unmarried couples expecting a child or who have a child 3 month old or younger. The couples participated in 16 hr of PREP via a group or a couple format over the course of 2-3 months. Couples relationship quality was assessed prior to and directly after the program. The results showed that men and women demonstrated significant gains in their communication skills, relationship functioning, friendship, dedication, and relationship confidence.

"Racial/ethnic differences in the influence of cultural values, alcohol resistance self-efficacy, and alcohol expectancies on risk for alcohol initiation.","Prior research has reported racial/ethnic differences in the early initiation of alcohol use, suggesting that cultural values that are central to specific racial/ethnic groups may be influencing these differences. This 1-year longitudinal study examines associations between two types of cultural values, parental respect (honor for one's parents) and familism (connectedness with family), both measured at baseline, and subsequent alcohol initiation in a sample of 6,054 (approximately 49% male, 57% Hispanic, 22% Asian, 18% non-Hispanic White, and 4% non-Hispanic Black) middle school students in Southern California. We tested whether the associations of cultural values with alcohol initiation could be explained by baseline measures of alcohol resistance self-efficacy (RSE) and alcohol expectancies. We also explored whether these pathways differed by race/ethnicity. In the full sample, adolescents with higher parental respect were less likely to initiate alcohol use, an association that was partially explained by higher RSE and fewer positive alcohol expectancies. Familism was not significantly related to alcohol initiation. Comparing racial/ethnic groups, higher parental respect was protective against alcohol initiation for Whites and Asians, but not Blacks or Hispanics. There were no racial/ethnic differences in the association between familism and alcohol initiation. Results suggest that cultural values are important factors in the decision to use alcohol and these values appear to operate in part, by influencing alcohol positive expectancies and RSE. Interventions that focus on maintaining strong cultural values and building strong bonds between adolescents and their families may help reduce the risk of alcohol initiation.",Psychology of addictive behaviors : journal of the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors,"[""prior"", ""research"", ""report"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""early"", ""initiation"", ""alcohol"", ""use"", ""suggest"", ""cultural"", ""value"", ""central"", ""specific"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""may"", ""influencing"", ""difference"", ""1"", ""year"", ""longitudinal"", ""examine"", ""association"", ""two"", ""type"", ""cultural"", ""value"", ""parental"", ""respect"", ""honor"", ""one"", ""parent"", ""familism"", ""connectedness"", ""family"", ""measure"", ""baseline"", ""subsequent"", ""alcohol"", ""initiation"", ""sample"", ""6"", ""054"", ""approximately"", ""49"", ""male"", ""57"", ""hispanic"", ""22"", ""asian"", ""18"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""4"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""black"", ""middle"", ""school"", ""student"", ""southern"", ""california"", ""test"", ""whether"", ""association"", ""cultural"", ""value"", ""alcohol"", ""initiation"", ""could"", ""explain"", ""baseline"", ""measure"", ""alcohol"", ""resistance"", ""self"", ""efficacy"", ""rse"", ""alcohol"", ""expectancy"", ""also"", ""explore"", ""whether"", ""pathway"", ""differ"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""full"", ""sample"", ""adolescent"", ""high"", ""parental"", ""respect"", ""less"", ""likely"", ""initiate"", ""alcohol"", ""use"", ""association"", ""partially"", ""explain"", ""high"", ""rse"", ""few"", ""positive"", ""alcohol"", ""expectancy"", ""familism"", ""significantly"", ""related"", ""alcohol"", ""initiation"", ""compare"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""high"", ""parental"", ""respect"", ""protective"", ""alcohol"", ""initiation"", ""white"", ""asian"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""association"", ""familism"", ""alcohol"", ""initiation"", ""suggest"", ""cultural"", ""value"", ""important"", ""factor"", ""decision"", ""use"", ""alcohol"", ""value"", ""appear"", ""operate"", ""part"", ""influence"", ""alcohol"", ""positive"", ""expectancy"", ""rse"", ""intervention"", ""focus"", ""maintain"", ""strong"", ""cultural"", ""value"", ""build"", ""strong"", ""bond"", ""adolescent"", ""family"", ""may"", ""help"", ""reduce"", ""risk"", ""alcohol"", ""initiation""]",None,None,None,"Black, Asian, Hispanic"
"Social hazards on the job: workplace abuse, sexual harassment, and racial discrimination--a study of Black, Latino, and White low-income women and men workers in the United States.","This study documents the prevalence of workplace abuse, sexual harassment at work, and lifetime experiences of racial discrimination among the United for Health cohort of 1,202 predominantly black, Latino, and white women and men low-income union workers in the Greater Boston area.

Workplace abuse in the past year, reported by slightly more than half the workers, was most frequently reported by the white men (69%). Sexual harassment at work in the past year was reported by 26 percent of the women and 22 percent of the men, with values of 20 percent or more in all racial/ ethnic-gender groups other than Latinas and white men. High exposure to racial discrimination was reported by 37 percent of the workers of color, compared with 10 percent of the white workers, with black workers reporting the greatest exposure (44%).

Comparing racial and ethnic populations based on Healthy People 2010 objectives.,"Objective - The Healthy People 2010 initiative (HP2010) specified objectives for improving the health of the nation, established baseline values, and set specific targets to be achieved by 2010. HP2010 objectives are based on two overarching goals: First, to increase years and quality of life, and second, to eliminate disparities among subgroups of the population. In this report racial and ethnic populations are compared based on progress toward targets, the size of disparities, and changes in disparity for specific sets of objectives. Methods - Progress is measured in terms of movement toward or away from the target between the HP2010 baseline and the most recent data point. Disparities are measured as the percent difference between the rate for the racial and ethnic population with the best or most favorable rate and the rates for the other racial and ethnic populations. Changes in disparity are measured in terms of the percentage point change in the percent difference from the best group rate between the baseline and the most recent data point. Some comparisons can be made based on objectives with data for five populations (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Hispanic or Latino, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white). Additional comparisons can be made for objectives with data for the three larger populations (Hispanic or Latino, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white). Results - Differences between populations in progress toward the targets for HP2010 objectives are observed; however, the majority of objectives was moving toward or had reached their targets for each population. Greater differences between racial and ethnic populations are evident in the size of disparities. Disparities for the American Indian or Alaska Native, the Hispanic or Latino and non-Hispanic black populations are greater than those for the Asian and non-Hispanic white populations. Between the baseline and the most recent data point, the number of objectives with increasing disparities was similar to the number of objectives with decreasing disparities and there was no change in disparity for most objectives. In order to achieve the two goals of HP2010, rates must improve and relative differences between populations must be reduced.",Healthy people statistical notes,"[""objective"", ""healthy"", ""people"", ""2010"", ""initiative"", ""hp2010"", ""specify"", ""objective"", ""improve"", ""health"", ""nation"", ""established"", ""baseline"", ""value"", ""set"", ""specific"", ""target"", ""achieve"", ""2010"", ""hp2010"", ""objective"", ""base"", ""two"", ""overarching"", ""goal"", ""first"", ""increase"", ""year"", ""quality"", ""life"", ""second"", ""eliminate"", ""disparity"", ""among"", ""subgroup"", ""population"", ""report"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""population"", ""compare"", ""base"", ""progress"", ""toward"", ""target"", ""size"", ""disparity"", ""change"", ""disparity"", ""specific"", ""set"", ""objective"", ""method"", ""progress"", ""measure"", ""term"", ""movement"", ""toward"", ""away"", ""target"", ""hp2010"", ""baseline"", ""recent"", ""datum"", ""point"", ""disparity"", ""measure"", ""percent"", ""difference"", ""rate"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""population"", ""well"", ""favorable"", ""rate"", ""rate"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""population"", ""change"", ""disparity"", ""measure"", ""term"", ""percentage"", ""point"", ""change"", ""percent"", ""difference"", ""good"", ""group"", ""rate"", ""baseline"", ""recent"", ""datum"", ""point"", ""comparison"", ""make"", ""base"", ""objective"", ""data"", ""five"", ""population"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""alaska"", ""native"", ""asian"", ""hispanic"", ""latino"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""black"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""additional"", ""comparison"", ""make"", ""objective"", ""data"", ""three"", ""large"", ""population"", ""hispanic"", ""latino"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""black"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""difference"", ""population"", ""progress"", ""toward"", ""target"", ""hp2010"", ""objective"", ""observe"", ""however"", ""majority"", ""objective"", ""move"", ""toward"", ""reach"", ""target"", ""population"", ""great"", ""difference"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""population"", ""evident"", ""size"", ""disparity"", ""disparity"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""alaska"", ""native"", ""hispanic"", ""latino"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""black"", ""population"", ""great"", ""asian"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""population"", ""baseline"", ""recent"", ""datum"", ""point"", ""number"", ""objective"", ""increase"", ""disparity"", ""similar"", ""number"", ""objective"", ""decrease"", ""disparity"", ""change"", ""disparity"", ""objective"", ""order"", ""achieve"", ""two"", ""goal"", ""hp2010"", ""rate"", ""must"", ""improve"", ""relative"", ""difference"", ""population"", ""must"", ""reduce""]",None,None,None,"Latino, Asian, Hispanic"

Ethnic differences in adolescents' identity status and associated behavior problems.,"The relationships between ethnicity and identity status and between identity status and behavior problems, social competence, and self-esteem were examined among 330 White, Black, Puerto Rican and Filipino students in an integrated high school. Identity status (i.e., achieved, moratorium, foreclosed, or diffuse) was defined on the basis of a 24-item self-report inventory on which students rated their explorations of options and/or commitments to choices in their occupational, political, and religious domains. Ethnic status was also assessed in an 8-item questionnaire which assessed exploration and commitment to one's ethnic role. White students in the upper grades reported significantly higher moratorium scale scores and perceived themselves as more likely to have explored and be committed to their ethnic role than minority youth. There were no significant ethnic differences in the relationships of identity status to behavior problems, social competence or self-esteem. Adolescent boys were significantly more likely to be in moratorium regarding their ethnic role than girls. Grade and sex differences in identity status were consistent with those predicted by developmental researchers.

Racial and ethnic patterns in firearms deaths.,"In the United States, there is currently an epidemic of firearms violence. Among victims of this violence, there are striking racial and ethnic patterns in the manners and circumstances of death. This study was conducted to explore and quantitate some of these differences. Autopsy and investigation reports of 554 consecutive firearms deaths in Dallas County, Texas, from March 1992 to February 1993 were reviewed. Overall suicide rates by race for 1970 and 1990 were calculated. Suicide rates for blacks have increased while overall rates (all races) have decreased slightly. Large racial and ethnic differences in the homicide-suicide ratio (H:S) were found (0.42 in non-Hispanic whites; 7.44 in others) (p < 0.001). Non-Hispanic whites who committed suicide with a firearm were less likely than other groups to do so with another person present (12% non-Hispanic whites; 49% others) (p < 0.001). Blacks and Asians who committed suicide with a firearm killed another person in 67% of witnessed cases (those with another person present during the incident). Whites (Hispanics and non-Hispanics) killed another person in only 12% of witnessed firearm suicides.

California's racial and ethnic minorities more adversely affected by asthma.,"In California, nearly 2.8 million adults and children (8%) had active asthma in 2003. Of Californians with active asthma, 890,000 are children (ages 0-17) and 1.8 million are adults (age 18 and above). The prevalence of active asthma varies by racial and ethnic group, with racial and ethnic minority groups affected more adversely by asthma. They are more likely to go to the emergency department for asthma care, miss more school and work days because of asthma, and have poorer health status. They are also more likely to lack access to health care and to live in conditions associated with asthma exacerbations. Among California children, the prevalence of active asthma varies by racial and ethnic groups-with the highest prevalence among African Americans (17%) and American Indians/Alaska Natives (17%), followed by whites (10%), Latinos (7%) and Asians (7%; Exhibit 1). Among adults, American Indians/Alaska Natives have the highest prevalence of active asthma (13%), followed by African Americans (10%), whites (9%), Asians (5%) and Latinos (5%).

Ethnoracial Differences in Social Determinants of Health and Acute Mental Health Symptoms Among Adults Hospitalized After Emergency Care.,"Research has established relationships between social determinants of health (SDOH) and mental health, with mixed findings on which ethnoracial groups are most vulnerable to deleterious outcomes. The current study examines ethnoracial differences in SDOH and their associations with acute mental health symptoms among patients hospitalized after emergency care. Using data collected in a multi-site study of 1,318 diverse adults admitted to inpatient units, we performed analyses using linear regression models. Findings show that Multiracial/Indigenous and Black adults had significantly higher discrimination and financial stress scores. However, compared with White adults, the positive association between extreme discrimination and acute mental health symptoms was diminished among Latinx (B=-2.3; p=.02) and Black individuals (B=-1.6; p=.05) as was the positive association between financial insecurity and acute mental health symptoms for Black adults (B=-2.3; p=.04).

"Familial influences on poverty among young children in black immigrant, U.S.-born black, and nonblack immigrant families.","This study examines how familial contexts affect poverty disparities between the children of immigrant and U.S.-born blacks, and among black and nonblack children of immigrants. Despite lower gross child poverty rates in immigrant than in U.S.-born black families, accounting for differences in family structure reveals that child poverty risks among blacks are highest in single-parent black immigrant families. In addition, within two-parent immigrant families, child poverty declines associated with increasing assimilation are greater than the respective declines in single-parent families. The heads of black immigrant households have more schooling than those of native-black households. However, increased schooling has a weaker negative association with child poverty among the former than among the latter. In terms of racial disparities among the children of immigrants, poverty rates are higher among black than nonblack children. This black disadvantage is, however, driven by the outcomes of first-generation children of African and Hispanic-black immigrants. The results also show that although children in refugee families face elevated poverty risks, these risks are higher among black than among nonblack children of refugees. In addition, the poverty-reducing impact associated with having an English-proficient household head is about three times lower among black children of immigrants than among non-Hispanic white children of immigrants.",Demography,"[""examine"", ""familial"", ""context"", ""affect"", ""poverty"", ""disparity"", ""child"", ""immigrant"", ""u"", ""bear"", ""black"", ""among"", ""black"", ""nonblack"", ""child"", ""immigrant"", ""despite"", ""low"", ""gross"", ""child"", ""poverty"", ""rate"", ""immigrant"", ""u"", ""bear"", ""black"", ""family"", ""account"", ""difference"", ""family"", ""structure"", ""reveal"", ""child"", ""poverty"", ""risk"", ""among"", ""black"", ""high"", ""single"", ""parent"", ""black"", ""immigrant"", ""family"", ""addition"", ""within"", ""two"", ""parent"", ""immigrant"", ""family"", ""child"", ""poverty"", ""decline"", ""associate"", ""increase"", ""assimilation"", ""great"", ""respective"", ""decline"", ""single"", ""parent"", ""family"", ""head"", ""black"", ""immigrant"", ""household"", ""school"", ""native"", ""black"", ""household"", ""however"", ""increase"", ""school"", ""weak"", ""negative"", ""association"", ""child"", ""poverty"", ""among"", ""former"", ""among"", ""latter"", ""term"", ""racial"", ""disparity"", ""among"", ""child"", ""immigrant"", ""poverty"", ""rate"", ""high"", ""among"", ""black"", ""nonblack"", ""child"", ""black"", ""disadvantage"", ""however"", ""drive"", ""outcome"", ""first"", ""generation"", ""child"", ""african"", ""hispanic"", ""black"", ""immigrant"", ""also"", ""show"", ""although"", ""child"", ""refugee"", ""family"", ""face"", ""elevated"", ""poverty"", ""risk"", ""risk"", ""high"", ""among"", ""black"", ""among"", ""nonblack"", ""child"", ""refugee"", ""addition"", ""poverty"", ""reducing"", ""impact"", ""associate"", ""english"", ""proficient"", ""household"", ""head"", ""three"", ""time"", ""low"", ""among"", ""black"", ""child"", ""immigrant"", ""among"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""child"", ""immigrant""]",None,None,poverty,Hispanic

Housing and wealth inequality: racial-ethnic differences in home equity in the United States.,"In our study, we took a first step toward broadening our understanding of the sources of both housing and wealth inequality by studying differences in housing equity among blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and non-Hispanic whites in the United States. Using data from the American Housing Survey, we found substantial and significant gaps in housing equity for blacks and Hispanics (but not for Asians) compared with whites, even after we controlled for a wide range of locational, life-cycle, socioeconomic, family, immigrant, and mortgage characteristics. Furthermore, the payoffs to many factors are notably weaker for minority than for white households. This finding is especially consistent across groups for the effects of age, socioeconomic status, and housing-market value. Blacks and Hispanics also uniformly receive less benefit from mortgage and housing characteristics than do whites. These findings lend credence to the burgeoning stratification perspective on wealth and housing inequality that acknowledges the importance of broader social and institutional processes of racial-ethnic stratification that advantage some groups, whites in this case, over others.",Demography,"[""take"", ""first"", ""step"", ""toward"", ""broaden"", ""understanding"", ""source"", ""housing"", ""wealth"", ""inequality"", ""study"", ""difference"", ""housing"", ""equity"", ""among"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""united"", ""state"", ""use"", ""datum"", ""american"", ""housing"", ""survey"", ""find"", ""substantial"", ""gap"", ""housing"", ""equity"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""compare"", ""white"", ""even"", ""control"", ""wide"", ""range"", ""locational"", ""life"", ""cycle"", ""socioeconomic"", ""family"", ""immigrant"", ""mortgage"", ""characteristic"", ""furthermore"", ""payoff"", ""many"", ""factor"", ""notably"", ""weak"", ""minority"", ""white"", ""household"", ""find"", ""especially"", ""consistent"", ""across"", ""group"", ""effect"", ""age"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""housing"", ""market"", ""value"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""also"", ""uniformly"", ""receive"", ""less"", ""benefit"", ""mortgage"", ""housing"", ""characteristic"", ""white"", ""finding"", ""lend"", ""credence"", ""burgeoning"", ""stratification"", ""perspective"", ""wealth"", ""housing"", ""inequality"", ""acknowledge"", ""importance"", ""broad"", ""social"", ""institutional"", ""process"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""stratification"", ""advantage"", ""group"", ""white"", ""case"", ""other""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,"Black, Asian, Hispanic"
Racial and Ethnic Differences in Tobacco Information Seeking and Information Sources: Findings From the 2015 Health Information National Trends Survey.,"This article describes sources of health information, types of tobacco information sought, and trust in sources of tobacco information among U.S. racial/ethnic groups (Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and Other). Cross-sectional data (N = 3,788) from a nationally representative survey, HINTS-FDA 2015, were analyzed to examine unadjusted and adjusted associations between race/ethnicity and (a) first source of health information, (b) tobacco information seeking, and (c) trust in sources of tobacco information. Adjusted associations controlled for current tobacco product use and sociodemographic variables. Findings indicated that the Internet was the most common first source of health information while health care providers were the second most common source for all racial/ethnic groups. Tobacco-related health information seeking was more prevalent than other tobacco product information seeking. Unadjusted analyses indicated that a higher proportion of Whites sought other tobacco product information compared to Asians and Pacific Islanders. Trust was rated highest for doctors while trust for health organizations was rated second highest. Asians and Pacific Islanders had higher trust in the government compared to all other groups. Blacks had higher trust in religious organizations compared to all other groups besides Hispanics. Blacks had higher trust for tobacco companies compared to Whites and Other. Many of these differences were attenuated in adjusted analyses. This research has implications for tobacco control practice and policymaking by identifying potential dissemination strategies.",Journal of health communication,"[""article"", ""describe"", ""source"", ""health"", ""information"", ""type"", ""tobacco"", ""information"", ""seek"", ""trust"", ""source"", ""tobacco"", ""information"", ""among"", ""u"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""white"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""pacific"", ""islander"", ""cross"", ""sectional"", ""datum"", ""n"", ""3"", ""788"", ""nationally"", ""representative"", ""survey"", ""hint"", ""fda"", ""2015"", ""analyze"", ""examine"", ""unadjusted"", ""adjusted"", ""association"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""first"", ""source"", ""health"", ""information"", ""b"", ""tobacco"", ""information"", ""seek"", ""c"", ""trust"", ""source"", ""tobacco"", ""information"", ""adjusted"", ""association"", ""control"", ""current"", ""tobacco"", ""product"", ""use"", ""sociodemographic"", ""variable"", ""finding"", ""indicate"", ""internet"", ""common"", ""first"", ""source"", ""health"", ""information"", ""health"", ""care"", ""provider"", ""second"", ""common"", ""source"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""tobacco"", ""related"", ""health"", ""information"", ""seek"", ""prevalent"", ""tobacco"", ""product"", ""information"", ""seek"", ""unadjusted"", ""analysis"", ""indicate"", ""high"", ""proportion"", ""white"", ""seek"", ""tobacco"", ""product"", ""information"", ""compare"", ""asians"", ""pacific"", ""islander"", ""trust"", ""rate"", ""high"", ""doctor"", ""trust"", ""health"", ""organization"", ""rate"", ""second"", ""high"", ""asian"", ""pacific"", ""islander"", ""high"", ""trust"", ""government"", ""compare"", ""group"", ""black"", ""high"", ""trust"", ""religious"", ""organization"", ""compare"", ""group"", ""besides"", ""hispanic"", ""black"", ""high"", ""trust"", ""tobacco"", ""company"", ""compare"", ""white"", ""many"", ""difference"", ""attenuate"", ""adjust"", ""analysis"", ""research"", ""implication"", ""tobacco"", ""practice"", ""policymaking"", ""identify"", ""potential"", ""dissemination"", ""strategy""]",None,None,None,"Black, Asian, Hispanic"
Focus group study of ethnically diverse low-income users of paid personal assistance services.,"This study examined the experiences of ethnically diverse, low-income consumers of paid personal assistance services (PAS) to understand the successes and problems they faced setting up and maintaining their assistance. A thematic analysis was conducted with transcripts from eight focus groups of ethnically homogeneous consumers (n = 67): African American, Latino, Chinese, Native American, and non-Hispanic white. These experienced consumers were generally satisfied with their current PAS but noted significant difficulties: Getting access to appropriate care, obtaining enough paid care to avoid unmet need, and dealing with confusing bureaucracies and cultural differences between them and agency staff/attendants. They desired more control over their care, including the use of paid family attendants when possible. Respondents recommended improved screening and training of attendants, more attendant time, higher wages for attendants, improved cultural sensitivity of attendants and agency staff, and greater consumer control over PAS. Although these low-income PAS consumers are ethnically and geographically diverse, the similarity of findings points to their ongoing struggle to access adequate high quality assistance.

Racial/ethnic variation in hypertension-related lifestyle behaviours among US women with self-reported hypertension.,"Healthy lifestyles such as regular physical activity, frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables, weight control/weight loss and limited alcohol consumption are effective and recommended in hypertension control. Using data collected from a total of 131 788 female participants (aged > or = 18 years) of the 2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we examined the racial/ethnic disparities in hypertension-related lifestyle behaviours in 36 770 US women with self-reported hypertension from five races/ethnicities (non-Hispanic white (29 237), non-Hispanic black (4288), Asian (445), American Indian/Alaska native (553) and Hispanic (2247)). The prevalence of hypertension varied by race/ethnicity, with the highest seen in non-Hispanic black population (36.9 versus 20.2-26.8% in other racial/ethnic groups). Of all hypertensive women, using non-Hispanic white women as the referent, we found that non-Hispanic black (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55-0.77), American Indian/Alaska native (AOR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.52-1.00) and Hispanic women (AOR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.57-0.86) were significantly less likely to engage in physical activity at recommended levels; non-Hispanic black women were more likely to consume > or = 8 servings per day of fruits and vegetables (AOR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.24-2.34), and less likely to report losing weight (AOR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.53-0.71). In addition, Hispanic hypertensive women were significantly more likely than non-Hispanic white women to receive weight-loss advice (AOR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.60-2.44). In contrast, non-Hispanic white women were significantly more likely than those from other races/ethnicities to consume alcoholic beverages or engage in binge drinking.

"Institutional Context Shapes the Physical Health of College Graduates Differently for U.S. White, Black, and Hispanic Adults.","Greater educational attainment is generally associated with healthier and longer lives. However, important heterogeneity in who benefits from educational attainment, how much, and why remains underexplored. In particular, in the United States, the physical health returns to educational attainment are not as large for minoritized racial and ethnic groups compared with individuals racialized as White. Yet, our current understanding of ethnoracial differences in educational health disparities is limited by an almost exclusive focus on the quantity of education attained without sufficient attention to heterogeneity within educational attainment categories, such as different institution types among college graduates. Using biomarker data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), we test whether the physical health of college graduates in early adulthood (aged 24-32) varies by institution type and for White, Black, and Hispanic adults. In considering the role of the college context, we conceptualize postsecondary institutions as horizontally stratified and racialized institutional spaces with different implications for the health of their graduates. Finally, we quantify the role of differential attendance at and returns to postsecondary institution type in shaping ethnoracialized health disparities among college graduates in early adulthood.",Demography,"[""great"", ""educational"", ""attainment"", ""generally"", ""associate"", ""healthier"", ""long"", ""live"", ""however"", ""important"", ""heterogeneity"", ""benefit"", ""educational"", ""attainment"", ""much"", ""remain"", ""underexplored"", ""particular"", ""united"", ""state"", ""physical"", ""health"", ""return"", ""educational"", ""attainment"", ""large"", ""minoritized"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""compare"", ""individual"", ""racialize"", ""white"", ""yet"", ""current"", ""understand"", ""ethnoracial"", ""difference"", ""educational"", ""health"", ""disparity"", ""limit"", ""almost"", ""exclusive"", ""focus"", ""quantity"", ""education"", ""attain"", ""without"", ""sufficient"", ""attention"", ""heterogeneity"", ""within"", ""educational"", ""attainment"", ""category"", ""different"", ""institution"", ""type"", ""among"", ""college"", ""graduate"", ""use"", ""biomarker"", ""datum"", ""national"", ""longitudinal"", ""adolescent"", ""adult"", ""health"", ""add"", ""health"", ""test"", ""whether"", ""physical"", ""health"", ""college"", ""graduate"", ""early"", ""adulthood"", ""aged"", ""24"", ""32"", ""vary"", ""institution"", ""type"", ""white"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""adult"", ""consider"", ""role"", ""college"", ""context"", ""conceptualize"", ""postsecondary"", ""institution"", ""horizontally"", ""stratify"", ""racialize"", ""institutional"", ""space"", ""different"", ""implication"", ""health"", ""graduate"", ""finally"", ""quantify"", ""role"", ""differential"", ""attendance"", ""return"", ""postsecondary"", ""institution"", ""type"", ""shape"", ""ethnoracialized"", ""health"", ""disparity"", ""among"", ""college"", ""graduate"", ""early"", ""adulthood""]",None,None,None,"Black, Hispanic"

Not quite color blind: ethnic and gender differences in attitudes toward older people among college students.,"Attitudes toward older people can influence how they are treated and their cognitive and physical health. The populations of the United States and many other countries have become more ethnically diverse, and are aging. Yet little research examines how ethnic diversity affects attitudes toward older people. Our study addresses this research gap. Using the Aging Semantic Differential, 592 university students expressed their attitudes toward older African-American, Hispanic, and White women and men. Repeated measures analysis of variance examined attitude differences by participant ethnicity and gender, and by the ethnicity and gender of evaluated individuals. Both African-American and White students had more positive attitudes toward older women and men of their own ethnic group.

Mean decline with aging in total cognition score (range, 0-35; standard deviation, 6.00) was 4.1 (0.68 standard deviations) per decade (95% confidence interval: 3.8, 4.4) and in recall score (range, 0-20; standard deviation, 3.84) was 2.3 (0.60 standard deviations) per decade (95% confidence interval: 2.1, 2.5). Older cohorts (compared with younger cohorts), women (compared with men), widows/widowers, and those never married (both compared with married individuals) declined faster, and non-Hispanic blacks (compared with non-Hispanic whites) and those in the bottom income quintile (compared with the top quintile) declined slower. Race and income differences in rates of decline were not sufficient to offset larger differences in baseline cognition scores.

"Population genetics of the D4S139, D10S28, D17S74 and D17S79 VNTR loci among Asian, black, Caucasian, Hispanic and Native American populations from Seattle.","We studied four variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) loci (D4S139, D10S28, D17S74, and D17S79) in five ethnic populations from the Seattle metropolitan area. DNA samples purified from randomly chosen individuals were digested with Hae III or Hinf I and probed with pH30, for D4S139; TBQ7 for D10S28; pCMM86 for D17S74 and pAC256 for D17S79. The allele frequencies, expected Hardy-Weinberg values, observed heterozygosities and genetic distances among the populations were obtained for all these loci. D4S139 restriction fragment lengths (RFLs) varied in size from 1.4 to 22 kilobase pairs (kbp). The observed heterozygosities (H) varied from 84% in Native American populations to 94% among Blacks. D10S28 RFLs varied in size from 650 base pairs (bp) to 10.1 kbp. H varied from 90% in Native Americans to 96% in Caucasians and Hispanics. D17S74 RFLs varied in size from 782 bp to 9.3 kbp.

Segmented assimilation and attitudes toward psychotherapy: a moderated mediation analysis.,"The present study examines the relations between acculturative stress, mental health, and attitudes toward psychotherapy, and whether these relations are the same for immigrants of color and White immigrants. This study predicted that acculturative stress would have a significant, negative relation with attitudes toward psychotherapy and that this relation would be moderated by race (immigrants of color and White immigrants) so that as acculturative stress increases, attitudes toward psychotherapy become more negative for immigrants of color but not White immigrants. Finally, mental health was predicted to mediate the relation between acculturative stress and attitudes toward psychotherapy for immigrants of color, but not White immigrants. Participants were 149 first-generation, immigrant, young adults, between the ages of 18 and 29, who identified as White, Black, Latino, or Asian.

Gendered racial exclusion among White internet daters.,"Acceptance by the dominant group reveals the current standing of racial groups in the U.S. hierarchy, as well as the possibility for assimilation. However, few researchers have addressed the gendered nature of racial preferences by whites. We examine whites' exclusion of blacks, Latinos, Asians, Middle Easterners, East Indians and Native Americans as possible dates, using a sample of profiles collected from an internet dating website. We find that white men are more willing than white women to date non-whites in general, yet, with the exception of their top two preferences for dates, whites and Latinos, the racial hierarchies of males and females differ. Among daters with stated racial preferences, white men are more likely to exclude blacks as possible dates, while white women are more likely to exclude Asians.

School context protective factors against peer ethnic discrimination across the high school years.,"Ethnically diverse high school contexts present unique social opportunities for youth to form interethnic relationships, but they may also subject students to certain social challenges such as peer ethnic discrimination. With a sample of 1,072 high school students (55% girls; 54% Latino, 20% African American, 14% Asian, 12% White) attending 84 high schools, school context factors that protect students' exposure to peer ethnic discrimination across the high school years were investigated with a three-level hierarchical linear model. Each spring for four consecutive years (grades 9-12), self-reported peer ethnic discrimination, interracial climate at school, and perceived school ethnic composition were assessed. At the school level, objective high school ethnic composition data were collected. Peer ethnic discrimination was found to decline slightly across the high school years. Above and beyond this decline, more positive perceptions of the school interracial climate and both objective and perceived numerical ethnic majority status predicted lower levels of peer ethnic discrimination. Taken together, the results highlight the significance of both objective (e.g., ethnic composition) and subjective (e.g., interracial climate) aspects of the school ethnic context to students' high school social experiences.",American journal of community psychology,"[""ethnically"", ""diverse"", ""high"", ""school"", ""context"", ""present"", ""unique"", ""social"", ""opportunity"", ""youth"", ""form"", ""interethnic"", ""relationship"", ""may"", ""also"", ""subject"", ""student"", ""certain"", ""social"", ""challenge"", ""peer"", ""ethnic"", ""discrimination"", ""sample"", ""1"", ""072"", ""high"", ""school"", ""student"", ""55"", ""girl"", ""54"", ""latino"", ""20"", ""african"", ""american"", ""14"", ""asian"", ""12"", ""white"", ""attend"", ""84"", ""high"", ""school"", ""school"", ""context"", ""factor"", ""protect"", ""student"", ""exposure"", ""peer"", ""ethnic"", ""discrimination"", ""across"", ""high"", ""school"", ""year"", ""investigate"", ""three"", ""level"", ""hierarchical"", ""linear"", ""model"", ""spring"", ""four"", ""consecutive"", ""year"", ""grade"", ""9"", ""12"", ""self"", ""report"", ""peer"", ""ethnic"", ""discrimination"", ""interracial"", ""climate"", ""school"", ""perceive"", ""school"", ""ethnic"", ""composition"", ""assess"", ""school"", ""level"", ""objective"", ""high"", ""school"", ""ethnic"", ""composition"", ""datum"", ""collect"", ""peer"", ""ethnic"", ""discrimination"", ""find"", ""decline"", ""slightly"", ""across"", ""high"", ""school"", ""year"", ""beyond"", ""decline"", ""positive"", ""perception"", ""school"", ""interracial"", ""climate"", ""objective"", ""perceive"", ""numerical"", ""ethnic"", ""majority"", ""status"", ""predict"", ""low"", ""level"", ""peer"", ""ethnic"", ""discrimination"", ""take"", ""together"", ""highlight"", ""significance"", ""objective"", ""e"", ""g"", ""ethnic"", ""composition"", ""subjective"", ""e"", ""g"", ""interracial"", ""climate"", ""aspect"", ""school"", ""ethnic"", ""context"", ""student"", ""high"", ""school"", ""social"", ""experience""]",None,None,None,"Latino, Asian"

The hypothesis was tested using 214 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia who were Korean American, Caucasian, African American, or Latino. Results supported the hypothesis.

A psychometric analysis of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale among four racial groups.,"Recent psychometric analyses examining the cross-cultural validity of key anxiety measures have suggested that some, such as the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI), may hold different psychometric characteristics among different racial or national groups. The Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) is a self-report measure that, like the ASI, appears to assess a predispositional risk for developing some anxiety and mood disorders. Despite its validation in both a French and English version, the majority of the research conducted on the IUS has used predominantly Caucasian samples. Given this, the purpose of this research was to examine and compare the psychometric properties of the IUS among non-clinical participants of four racial groups: African American, Caucasian, Hispanic/Latino, and Southeast Asian. The data suggested generally strong, and highly similar, estimates of reliability and validity across the four racial groups.

"Relationships between body image and depressive symptoms during postpartum in ethnically diverse, low income women.","The aim of this study was to examine body image, depressive symptoms, and their interrelationship at post-delivery and at 6 weeks postpartum in a triethnic sample of low income new mothers. Data for this study were drawn from the Austin New Mothers Study. Participants were 76 Anglo/White, 72 African American, and 135 Hispanic new mothers who were participating in Medicaid, at least 18 years old, free of medical risk factors, and delivered at term. Body image was measured by the Body Cathexis Scale (BCS) and depressive symptoms by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The leading areas of body dissatisfaction in postpartum were similar across ethnic groups. At 6 weeks postpartum Anglo women had the highest number of body image components perceived negatively, whereas African-American women had the least. In the overall sample, body image attitudes were significantly related to depressive symptoms in correlational (r's .19 to .34) and regression analyses. In addition, African American ethnicity was associated in regression analyses with higher depressive symptoms. Neither African American nor Hispanic ethnicity significantly moderated the relationship between body image attitudes and depressive symptoms in tests of interactions. Marital/partnered status and income level were related to depressive symptoms at both time points. In addition, being a woman with a parity of II was associated with higher depressive symptoms at 6 weeks postpartum.

"Racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare use, delayed care, and management of diabetes mellitus in older adults in California.","This study examined racial and ethnic differences in healthcare use, delayed care, and management of care of older adults with a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Drawing on the 2009 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), the sample included 3,003 adults (representative of N = 998,795) aged 60 and older from five racial and ethnic groups: non-Hispanic white (n = 2,153), African American (n = 213), Hispanic (n = 336), Asian (n = 306), and American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) (n = 59). All self-reported a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were conducted using weighted data. Results from adjusted logistic regressions indicated significant racial and ethnic differences between non-Hispanic white elderly and the other groups examined. Specifically, African Americans were significantly less likely than whites to see a doctor and to have a usual source of care, and were more likely to visit the emergency department (ED) for diabetes mellitus and to have their feet examined by a provider. Hispanics were significantly less likely to take medicine to lower cholesterol but were more likely to test their blood glucose regularly (following ADA guidelines). Asians were significantly less likely than whites to test their blood glucose regularly or have a foot examination. AI/ANs were significantly less likely than whites to see a doctor, visit an ED, and take medication to reduce heart attack risk but were more likely to use insulin, oral diabetic medication, or both.

The influence of ethnic identity on drug use among ethnic minority adolescents.,"Ethnic identity is a significant factor related to self-concept and psychological development and similar to other aspects of identity, is of particular importance during the adolescent years when there is increased vulnerability to drug involvement. However, much of the research relative to adolescent drug use has focused on the annual and current prevalence rates among particular ethnic groups with little attention to ethnic or group identity issues. However, it is important to study and compare ethnic and group identity and its correlates to drug use. This article presents face-to-face interview questionnaire measures of ethnic identity as measured by affirmation and belongingness, ethnic identity achievement, ethnic behavior, and other group orientation [1], and drug use as measured by misuse, abuse, and chemical dependency diagnoses [2]. The questionnaires were administered to 127 (60 Ethnic, 67 White) adolescents from ethnically diverse schools in a large urban school district in the Pacific Northwest. The relationship of ethnic identity to drug use was examined. This study indicates that the questionnaire measures can be used to examine similarities and differences in ethnic identity and drug use among adolescents from different ethnic groups. A key finding of this study was that white adolescents scored lower in ethnic identity than did members of the four ethnic minority groups and the mixed racial group. However, the most significant key finding was that in the ethnic minority sample high levels of cultural identity were associated with heavy drug use. The results of this study suggest that social influences may play a larger role in the development of heavy drug use irrespective of the nature and origins of these social influences.",Journal of drug education,"[""ethnic"", ""identity"", ""factor"", ""related"", ""self"", ""concept"", ""psychological"", ""development"", ""similar"", ""aspect"", ""identity"", ""particular"", ""importance"", ""adolescent"", ""year"", ""increase"", ""vulnerability"", ""drug"", ""involvement"", ""however"", ""much"", ""research"", ""relative"", ""adolescent"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""focus"", ""annual"", ""current"", ""prevalence"", ""rate"", ""among"", ""particular"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""little"", ""attention"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""identity"", ""issue"", ""however"", ""important"", ""compare"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""identity"", ""correlate"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""article"", ""present"", ""face"", ""face"", ""interview"", ""questionnaire"", ""measure"", ""ethnic"", ""identity"", ""measure"", ""affirmation"", ""belongingness"", ""ethnic"", ""identity"", ""achievement"", ""ethnic"", ""behavior"", ""group"", ""orientation"", ""1"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""measure"", ""misuse"", ""abuse"", ""chemical"", ""dependency"", ""diagnosis"", ""2"", ""questionnaire"", ""administer"", ""127"", ""60"", ""ethnic"", ""67"", ""white"", ""adolescent"", ""ethnically"", ""diverse"", ""school"", ""large"", ""urban"", ""school"", ""district"", ""pacific"", ""northwest"", ""relationship"", ""ethnic"", ""identity"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""examine"", ""indicate"", ""questionnaire"", ""measure"", ""use"", ""examine"", ""similarity"", ""difference"", ""ethnic"", ""identity"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""among"", ""adolescent"", ""different"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""key"", ""find"", ""white"", ""adolescent"", ""score"", ""low"", ""ethnic"", ""identity"", ""member"", ""four"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""group"", ""mixed"", ""racial"", ""group"", ""however"", ""key"", ""find"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""sample"", ""high"", ""level"", ""cultural"", ""identity"", ""associate"", ""heavy"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""suggest"", ""social"", ""influence"", ""may"", ""play"", ""large"", ""role"", ""development"", ""heavy"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""irrespective"", ""nature"", ""origin"", ""social"", ""influence""]",None,None,None,None

"Using focus groups to develop a heart disease prevention program for ethnically diverse, low-income women.","Although low-income women have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than higher-income women, health promotion and disease prevention are often low priorities due to financial, family, and health care constraints. In addition, most low-income women live in environments that tend to support and even promote high risk CVD behaviors. Low-income African-American, Hispanic, and White women constitute one of the largest groups at high risk for CVD but few heart disease prevention programs have effectively reached them. The purpose of this project was to use feedback from focus groups to generate ideas about how to best structure and implement future CVD intervention programs tailored to low-income populations. Seven focus groups were conducted with 51 low-income African-American, Hispanic, and White women from two urban and two agricultural communities in California. The women in the study shared many common experiences and barriers to healthy lifestyles, despite their ethnic diversity. Results of the focus groups showed that women preferred heart disease prevention programs that would address multiple CVD risk factors, emphasize staying healthy for themselves, teach specific skills about how to adopt heart-healthy behaviors, and offer them choices in effecting behavioral change. For health information, they preferred visual formats to written formats. They also expressed a desire to develop knowledge to help them separate health ""myths"" from health ""facts"" in order to reduce their misconceptions about CVD.

Relation of childhood worry to information-processing factors in an ethnically diverse community sample.,"This study examined information-processing variables in relation to worry in a sample of 292 fifth-grade children from Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic backgrounds. Results revealed that worry was related to threat interpretations for hypothetical situations and, when stress level was not controlled, to higher estimates of future occurrence for perceived threatening situations and ineffective solution choices. In addition, environmental and individual factors such as stress, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES) were found to be important predictors of information-processing variables. Ethnicity did not predict children's information processing when stress level and SES were controlled; however, it interacted with worry to predict problem-solving confidence.

Prevalence of the factor V-Leiden mutation in four distinct American ethnic populations.,"Resistance to activated protein C (APC) is the most common risk factor for venous thromboembolism, a major cause of morbidity and mortality with an incidence of about 1/1,000 per year. The Arg 506 to Gln mutation in exon 10 of the coagulation factor V gene (factor V-Leiden) has been found to be responsible for over 90% of the APC resistance cases and is an autosomal dominant trait. Initial studies have suggested that this mutation is restricted to individuals of European Caucasian extraction with an average allele frequency in European and American Caucasians of 4.4%, making it one of the most common monogenic disorders in the Caucasian population. A limited number of other ethnic populations have been tested and the mutation has been found only rarely. In our multiethnic survey of 602 individuals, Hispanic-Americans had the highest observed frequency of the factor V-Leiden mutant allele, 1.65%, while African-Americans had a somewhat lower frequency, 0.87%. No factor V-Leiden mutations were found in 191 Asian-Americans or 54 Native-Americans tested. These results indicate that the factor V-Leiden mutation segregates in populations with significant Caucasian admixture and is rare in genetically distant non-European groups.

Mutual partner violence: mental health symptoms among female and male victims in four racial/ethnic groups.,"This study examines racial/ethnic and sex differences in the prevalence of mutual intimate partner violence (IPV) and mental health symptoms. The authors asked 676 university students in heterosexual relationships if they had experienced IPV, coercive victimization, and/or perpetration as well as symptoms of depression, anxiety, hostility, and somatization. Analyses were conducted separately for female and male respondents in four racial/ethnic groups, totaling eight groups (female and male groups each for African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, and European Americans). Men, as compared to women, reported stronger correlations between IPV perpetration and IPV victimization, with Asian American men reporting the highest associations of any group. Additionally, experiencing higher partner and coercive violence was significantly related to increased mental health symptoms for all groups except Asian American men.

"Obesity prevalence among low-income, preschool-aged children--New York City and Los Angeles County, 2003-2011.","Recent studies have reported evidence of a leveling and decline in childhood obesity prevalence in New York and California. However, some areas of the United States continue to experience increases in the prevalence of childhood obesity. To assess differences and changes over time in early childhood obesity in the two most populous cities in the United States, obesity prevalence among low-income, preschool-aged children enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in New York City (NYC) was compared with obesity prevalence among WIC-enrolled children in Los Angeles County (LAC) during 2003-2011. In NYC, from 2003 to 2011, obesity prevalence decreased among blacks, whites, and Hispanics, but increased among Asians. In LAC, obesity prevalence decreased among Asians and increased and then decreased among blacks and Hispanics from 2003 to 2011. Hispanic WIC-enrolled children had the greatest prevalence of obesity for all years in both areas. In 2011, the obesity prevalence among Hispanics in NYC was 19.1%, compared with 21.7% in LAC.

Data from 1999, 2001 and 2003 waves of the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics provide no evidence of racial/ethnic variation in the health consequences of involuntary job loss. However, associations between leaving jobs voluntarily and poor self-assessed health are larger for Black and Hispanic workers than for White workers.

Health disparities in awareness of physical activity and cancer prevention: findings from the National Cancer Institute's 2007 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS).,"This national study examines differences between racial/ethnic groups on awareness of physical activity and reduced cancer risk and explores correlates of awareness including trust, demographic, and health characteristics within racial/ethnic groups. The 2007 Health Information and National Trends Survey (HINTS) provided data for this study. After exclusions, 6,809 adults were included in analyses. Awareness of physical activity in reduced cancer risk was the main outcome. Logistic regression models tested relationships. Non-Hispanic Blacks had a 0.71 (0.54,0.93) lower odds of being aware of physical activity in reduced cancer risk than non-Hispanic Whites. Current attempts to lose weight were associated with greater odds for awareness among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics (p < .01). Among non-Hispanic Blacks, trust in traditional and Internet media was associated with greater odds of awareness (p < .01). This study is the first national study to examine racial/ethnic disparities in awareness of physical activity and cancer risk.

The impact of school transitions in early adolescence on the self-system and perceived social context of poor urban youth.,"This study examined the effects of the normative school transition (n = 580) during early adolescence on the self-system and perceived school and peer social contexts of poor, black (n = 161), white (n = 146), and Latino (n = 273) youth in the public school systems of 3 eastern urban cities. The results revealed negative effects of the school transition on the affective and behavioral domains of the self-system. These declines in self-esteem, class preparation, and grade-point average (GPA) were common across race/ethnicity and gender. Concurrently, the school transition was perceived to be associated with changes in the school and peer contexts. Daily hassles with the school increased, while social support and extracurricular involvement decreased over the transition. Daily hassles with peers decreased, and peer values were perceived as more antisocial. These changes in the school and peer microsystems were also common across race/ethnicity and gender. In addition, transition-associated school and peer changes and, in particular, changes in daily hassles with the school were associated with changes in the academic dimensions of the self-system, that is, academic efficacy expectations, class preparation, and GPA.

Secondary transfer effects of interracial contact: the moderating role of social status.,"The contact hypothesis asserts that intergroup attitudes can be improved when groups have opportunities to interact with each other. Recent research extending the contact hypothesis suggests that contact with a primary outgroup can decrease bias toward outgroups not directly involved in the interaction, which is known as the secondary transfer effect (STE). The present study contributes to growing research on STEs by investigating effects among Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White undergraduate students (N = 3,098) attending 28 selective colleges and universities. Using hierarchical linear modeling, our results reveal numerous positive STEs among Asian, Black, and Hispanic college students. No significant STEs were observed among White students. Mediated moderation analyses support an attitude generalization mechanism, because STEs were explained by changes in attitudes toward the primary outgroup.

Neighborhood effects on the self-rated health of older adults from four racial/ethnic groups.,"Building upon the sizable literature on individual-level predictors of self-rated health, this study examined the impact of neighborhood characteristics, using older adult samples of four racial/ethnic groups. The considered neighborhood characteristics include (a) the proportion of individuals age 65 and older, (b) the proportion of individuals below poverty, and (c) the proportion of individuals from the same racial/ethnic background in the Census-block group. The samples were drawn from the 2004-2005 Survey of Older Floridians, which includes Whites (n = 488), Blacks (n = 345), Cubans (n = 319), and non-Cuban Latinos (n = 230). Using the reported residential address, each participant was linked to the 2000 Census at block-group level to retrieve the above-mentioned neighborhood characteristics. Multilevel analysis of self-rated health was estimated for each racial/ethnic group, considering individual-level variables (e.g., age, gender, marital status, education, financial strain, and chronic conditions) and each of the neighborhood characteristics. Regardless of racial/ethnic groups, those living in the neighborhood with a higher proportion of residents below poverty were likely to report poorer health. The proportion of older adults in the neighborhood was significant only in Cubans, and the proportion of residents with the same ethnic background was only in Whites. The findings show the overall importance of neighborhood context in the health of older adults and indicate different implications of neighborhood characteristics for diverse racial/ethnic groups.",Social work in public health,"[""building"", ""upon"", ""sizable"", ""literature"", ""individual"", ""level"", ""predictor"", ""self"", ""rate"", ""health"", ""examine"", ""impact"", ""neighborhood"", ""characteristic"", ""use"", ""old"", ""adult"", ""sample"", ""four"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""consider"", ""neighborhood"", ""characteristic"", ""include"", ""proportion"", ""individual"", ""age"", ""65"", ""old"", ""b"", ""proportion"", ""individual"", ""poverty"", ""c"", ""proportion"", ""individual"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""background"", ""census"", ""block"", ""group"", ""sample"", ""draw"", ""2004"", ""2005"", ""survey"", ""old"", ""floridian"", ""include"", ""white"", ""n"", ""488"", ""black"", ""n"", ""345"", ""cuban"", ""n"", ""319"", ""non"", ""cuban"", ""latinos"", ""n"", ""230"", ""use"", ""report"", ""residential"", ""address"", ""participant"", ""link"", ""2000"", ""census"", ""block"", ""group"", ""level"", ""retrieve"", ""mention"", ""neighborhood"", ""characteristic"", ""multilevel"", ""analysis"", ""self"", ""rate"", ""health"", ""estimate"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""consider"", ""individual"", ""level"", ""variable"", ""e"", ""g"", ""age"", ""gender"", ""marital"", ""status"", ""education"", ""financial"", ""strain"", ""chronic"", ""condition"", ""neighborhood"", ""characteristic"", ""regardless"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""live"", ""neighborhood"", ""high"", ""proportion"", ""resident"", ""poverty"", ""likely"", ""report"", ""poor"", ""health"", ""proportion"", ""old"", ""adult"", ""neighborhood"", ""cuban"", ""proportion"", ""resident"", ""ethnic"", ""background"", ""white"", ""finding"", ""show"", ""overall"", ""importance"", ""neighborhood"", ""context"", ""health"", ""old"", ""adult"", ""indicate"", ""different"", ""implication"", ""neighborhood"", ""characteristic"", ""diverse"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group""]",None,None,poverty,"Black, Latino"
The Contributions of Places to Metropolitan Ethnoracial Diversity and Segregation: Decomposing Change Across Space and Time.,"Although the trend toward greater ethnoracial diversity in the United States has been documented at a variety of geographic scales, most research tracks diversity one scale at a time. Our study bridges scales, asking how the diversity and segregation patterns of metropolitan areas are influenced by shifts in the racial/ethnic composition of their constituent places. Drawing on 1980-2010 decennial census data, we use a new visual tool to compare the distributions of place diversity for 50 U.S. metro areas over three decades. We also undertake a decomposition analysis of segregation within these areas to evaluate hypotheses about the roles of different types of places in ethnoracial change. The decomposition indicates that although principal cities continue to shape the overall diversity of metro areas, their relative impact has declined since 1980. Inner suburbs have experienced substantial increases in diversity during the same period. Places with large white majorities now contribute more to overall metropolitan diversity than in the past. In contrast, majority black and majority Hispanic places contribute less to metropolitan diversity than in the past. The complexity of the patterns we observe is underscored through an inspection of two featured metropolises: Chicago and Dallas.",Demography,"[""although"", ""trend"", ""toward"", ""great"", ""ethnoracial"", ""diversity"", ""united"", ""state"", ""document"", ""variety"", ""geographic"", ""scale"", ""research"", ""track"", ""diversity"", ""one"", ""scale"", ""time"", ""bridge"", ""scale"", ""ask"", ""diversity"", ""segregation"", ""pattern"", ""metropolitan"", ""area"", ""influence"", ""shift"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""composition"", ""constituent"", ""place"", ""draw"", ""1980"", ""2010"", ""decennial"", ""census"", ""datum"", ""use"", ""new"", ""visual"", ""tool"", ""compare"", ""distribution"", ""place"", ""diversity"", ""50"", ""u"", ""metro"", ""area"", ""three"", ""decade"", ""also"", ""undertake"", ""decomposition"", ""analysis"", ""segregation"", ""within"", ""area"", ""evaluate"", ""hypothesis"", ""role"", ""different"", ""type"", ""place"", ""ethnoracial"", ""change"", ""decomposition"", ""indicate"", ""although"", ""principal"", ""city"", ""continue"", ""shape"", ""overall"", ""diversity"", ""metro"", ""area"", ""relative"", ""impact"", ""decline"", ""since"", ""1980"", ""inner"", ""suburb"", ""experience"", ""substantial"", ""increase"", ""diversity"", ""period"", ""place"", ""large"", ""white"", ""majority"", ""contribute"", ""overall"", ""metropolitan"", ""diversity"", ""past"", ""contrast"", ""majority"", ""black"", ""majority"", ""hispanic"", ""place"", ""contribute"", ""less"", ""metropolitan"", ""diversity"", ""past"", ""complexity"", ""pattern"", ""observe"", ""underscore"", ""inspection"", ""two"", ""feature"", ""metropolis"", ""chicago"", ""dalla""]",None,None,None,Hispanic
"Changes in the incomes of age groups, 1984-89.","In terms of changes in the incomes of age groups, the 1984-89 period was very different from the periods that immediately preceded it. This summary focuses on changes for aged family units. During the 1984-89 period, the rate of growth of real median income of aged units was substantially lower than in other subperiods since 1967, the first year for which comparable detailed estimates are available. During the 1984-89 period, the ratio of aged to nonaged median incomes fell for 4 consecutive years, after generally rising since about 1970. The relative medians of almost all detailed aged age groups fell at least slightly from 1984 to 1989, after a period of substantial rises. The increases in income for aged units during 1984-89 were higher for high-income units than for low-income units, producing an increase in inequality. The percentage of aged persons who were poor fell slightly from 1984 to 1989, but that percentage remained above the rates for other adult age groups. A relatively high percentage of aged persons had income that was less than 50 percent above the poverty threshold. The increase in the real mean total income of aged units from 1984 to 1989 was the net result of substantial increases in earnings and pension income and a substantial decrease in property income. In contrast, the much larger increase in real mean total income for aged units from 1979 to 1984 was characterized by a large increase in property income, substantial increases in Social Security benefits and pension income, and a small decrease in earnings.",Social security bulletin,"[""term"", ""change"", ""income"", ""age"", ""group"", ""1984"", ""89"", ""period"", ""different"", ""period"", ""immediately"", ""precede"", ""summary"", ""focus"", ""change"", ""aged"", ""family"", ""unit"", ""1984"", ""89"", ""period"", ""rate"", ""growth"", ""real"", ""median"", ""income"", ""aged"", ""unit"", ""substantially"", ""low"", ""subperiod"", ""since"", ""1967"", ""first"", ""year"", ""comparable"", ""detailed"", ""estimate"", ""available"", ""1984"", ""89"", ""period"", ""ratio"", ""aged"", ""nonaged"", ""median"", ""income"", ""fall"", ""4"", ""consecutive"", ""year"", ""generally"", ""rise"", ""since"", ""1970"", ""relative"", ""median"", ""almost"", ""detailed"", ""aged"", ""age"", ""group"", ""fall"", ""least"", ""slightly"", ""1984"", ""1989"", ""period"", ""substantial"", ""rise"", ""increase"", ""income"", ""aged"", ""unit"", ""1984"", ""89"", ""high"", ""high"", ""income"", ""unit"", ""low"", ""income"", ""unit"", ""produce"", ""increase"", ""inequality"", ""percentage"", ""aged"", ""person"", ""poor"", ""fall"", ""slightly"", ""1984"", ""1989"", ""percentage"", ""remain"", ""rate"", ""adult"", ""age"", ""group"", ""relatively"", ""high"", ""percentage"", ""aged"", ""person"", ""income"", ""less"", ""50"", ""percent"", ""poverty"", ""threshold"", ""increase"", ""real"", ""mean"", ""total"", ""income"", ""aged"", ""unit"", ""1984"", ""1989"", ""net"", ""result"", ""substantial"", ""increase"", ""earning"", ""pension"", ""income"", ""substantial"", ""decrease"", ""property"", ""income"", ""contrast"", ""much"", ""large"", ""increase"", ""real"", ""mean"", ""total"", ""income"", ""aged"", ""unit"", ""1979"", ""1984"", ""characterize"", ""large"", ""increase"", ""property"", ""income"", ""substantial"", ""increase"", ""social"", ""security"", ""benefit"", ""pension"", ""income"", ""small"", ""decrease"", ""earning""]",None,None,poverty,None
"Trends in Obesity Among Participants Aged 2-4 Years in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children - United States, 2000-2014.","Childhood obesity is associated with negative health consequences in childhood (1) that continue into adulthood (2), putting adults at risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers (1). Obesity disproportionately affects children from low-income families (3). Through a collaboration with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), CDC has begun to use data from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Participants and Program Characteristics (WIC PC) to replace the Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System (PedNSS) (4,5) for obesity surveillance among young children from low-income families. CDC examined trends in obesity prevalence during 2000-2014 among WIC participants aged 2-4 years using WIC PC data. Overall obesity prevalence increased from 14.0% in 2000 to 15.5% in 2004 and 15.9% in 2010, and then decreased to 14.5% in 2014.

"The role of perfectionism in obsessive-compulsive symptoms: ""not just right"" experiences and checking compulsions.","Perfectionism has long been considered an important cognitive variable in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, little research has examined the components of perfectionism and their role in specific OCD symptoms. The current study is the first to examine the role of maladaptive perfectionism in predicting checking compulsions and ""not just right"" (NJR) obsessions. Using an undergraduate sample, linear structural relations were applied to these constructs. A mediational model was tested, where trait anxiety was hypothesized to mediate the relationship between obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as assessed with the Vancouver Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (VOCI) and maladaptive perfectionism, as measured by four subscales of the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS). Trait anxiety was assessed with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The results support the fully mediated model for checking and NJR compulsions.

The Quick Health Data Online: the ultimate interactive database on recent trends in women's health.,"A growing number of nonprofit and government agencies have developed interactive databases to help their website visitors and constituents obtain information about past and recent trends in healthcare. The Office on Women's Health of the Department of Health and Human Services has joined this pursuit by launching Quick Health Data Online (QHData), an interactive database providing health statistics that specifically pertain to women. Since its inception, QHData has quickly emerged as the leader in sophisticated and user-friendly interactive databases. What is so remarkable about QHData? This database is capable of generating health statistics by race (i.e., blacks, whites, Asian and Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, and Native Americans), gender, and age. The results can also be produced across different geographic levels-the nation, by region, state, and county; the jurisdiction statuses of the counties can also be identified as a border, frontier, metropolitan, urban, or rural.

Both models were most salient for EAs followed by African Americans (AAs) and Spanish-speaking Hispanics, but less so for English-speaking Hispanics (EHs) and Asian Americans.

Ethnic minority baccalaureate nursing student academic dismissal: a description of the antecedent academic characteristics.,"Dismissal for academic reasons from a baccalaureate nursing (BSN) program is a phenomenon that has rarely been discussed in the literature, and, as a result, little is known about the academic characteristics of the students who are dismissed. Presently, minority students that have been admitted to BSN programs are less likely to graduate from their respective nursing programs than White BSN students are, but whether or not ethnic minority student attrition is due to academic dismissal has not been clearly described. In addition, the antecedent academic characteristics that may identify minority BSN students at high risk for academic dismissal are not fully understood. Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to describe the academic characteristics ofa sample of minority BSN students who experienced academic dismissal. A secondary purpose was to compare ethnic minority BSN students who were dismissed with a sample of ethnic minority BSN students who were academically successful. The results revealed that ethnic minority BSN students who were dismissed for academic reasons tended to have low scholastic and nursing aptitudes, and that nursing aptitudes were higher among ethnic minority BSN students who were academically successful.",Journal of National Black Nurses' Association : JNBNA,"[""dismissal"", ""academic"", ""reason"", ""baccalaureate"", ""nursing"", ""bsn"", ""program"", ""phenomenon"", ""rarely"", ""discuss"", ""literature"", ""result"", ""little"", ""known"", ""academic"", ""characteristic"", ""student"", ""dismiss"", ""presently"", ""minority"", ""student"", ""admit"", ""bsn"", ""program"", ""less"", ""likely"", ""graduate"", ""respective"", ""nursing"", ""program"", ""white"", ""bsn"", ""student"", ""whether"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""student"", ""attrition"", ""due"", ""academic"", ""dismissal"", ""clearly"", ""describe"", ""addition"", ""antecedent"", ""academic"", ""characteristic"", ""may"", ""identify"", ""minority"", ""bsn"", ""student"", ""high"", ""risk"", ""academic"", ""dismissal"", ""fully"", ""understand"", ""thus"", ""primary"", ""purpose"", ""describe"", ""academic"", ""characteristic"", ""ofa"", ""sample"", ""minority"", ""bsn"", ""student"", ""experience"", ""academic"", ""dismissal"", ""secondary"", ""purpose"", ""compare"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""bsn"", ""student"", ""dismiss"", ""sample"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""bsn"", ""student"", ""academically"", ""successful"", ""reveal"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""bsn"", ""student"", ""dismiss"", ""academic"", ""reason"", ""tend"", ""low"", ""scholastic"", ""nursing"", ""aptitude"", ""nursing"", ""aptitude"", ""higher"", ""among"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""bsn"", ""student"", ""academically"", ""successful""]",None,None,None,None

Gender and ethnic differences in the health practices of the elderly poor.,"Gender and ethnic differences in personal health practices were examined with a sample of 1021 Medicaid recipients aged 65 years and older. Six different health practices were examined including smoking, drinking, weight control, exercise, and social networks. Although gender differences were noted with respect to all of the health practices examined, neither men nor women were consistently favored in adhering to desired health practices. Perhaps most importantly, women were more apt than men to refrain from smoking and drinking which have been strongly linked to major health consequences. Ethnicity was also a factor in all of the health practices examined.

"Health Care Satisfaction: Effects of Immigration, Acculturation, Language.","Differences in health care satisfaction can alter patterns of health care utilization and so affect health outcomes, but little is known about variation in satisfaction in relation to immigration status. Health care satisfaction is analyzed with survey data from state public health program patients. Overall health care satisfaction is higher for first generation Hispanic immigrants and lower among those in the second generation compared to white Americans-consistent with the pattern termed the ""healthy migrant effect."" This pattern is more pronounced for Portuguese-speaking immigrants and is not explained by self-reported health, communication ability or acculturation. Satisfaction with specific aspects of health care follows different patterns that may be explained by differences in experiences and culture. As anticipated by segmented assimilation theory, we find variation in cross-generational patterns of health care satisfaction both within and between ethnic groups. This variation indicates the importance of distinguishing Portuguese-speakers from Spanish-speakers and of taking into account differences in the ways they are able to communicate with health care providers as well as differences in their orientations toward health care. Our disparate findings with other immigrant groups also reinforce limiting expectations of a ""healthy migrant effect"" to Latinos.

Logistic and negative binomial regression was used to examine the association between HRQoL (assessed with the CDC unhealthy days measures) and self-reported racial discrimination. Discrimination was reported by 10% of Whites, 57% of Blacks, and 24-31% of the Latino groups. These reports were associated with increased number of unhealthy days, disability days, and poor self-rated health, even after, controlling for education and other factors.

Prevalence of weight reducing and weight gaining in adolescent girls and boys.,"This is a survey of the prevalence of weight reducing and weight gaining in high school children. Our sample of 1,373 high school girls and boys was geographically, racially, and economically diverse. On the day of the survey, 63% of the girls and 16.2% of the boys reported being on weight reducing regimens; 9.1% of the girls and 28.4% of the boys were trying to gain weight. Most female reducers and male gainers were already normal weight. Compared to other racial groups, whites and Hispanics were more likely to be reducing, whereas blacks were more likely to be gaining. Exercise and moderate caloric reduction were most popular for weight reducing, and a small but significant number were regularly using fasting, vomiting, laxatives, and appetite suppressants. The direction of weight modification for girls and boys conformed to stereotyped physical ideals. The rate of weight reducing in female high school adolescents has increased significantly since similar surveys of American youths 20 years ago.","Health psychology : official journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association","[""survey"", ""prevalence"", ""weight"", ""reduce"", ""weight"", ""gain"", ""high"", ""school"", ""child"", ""sample"", ""1"", ""373"", ""high"", ""school"", ""girl"", ""boy"", ""geographically"", ""racially"", ""economically"", ""diverse"", ""day"", ""survey"", ""63"", ""girl"", ""16"", ""2"", ""boy"", ""report"", ""weight"", ""reduce"", ""regimen"", ""9"", ""1"", ""girl"", ""28"", ""4"", ""boy"", ""try"", ""gain"", ""weight"", ""female"", ""reducer"", ""male"", ""gainer"", ""already"", ""normal"", ""weight"", ""compare"", ""racial"", ""group"", ""white"", ""hispanic"", ""likely"", ""reduce"", ""whereas"", ""black"", ""likely"", ""gain"", ""exercise"", ""moderate"", ""caloric"", ""reduction"", ""popular"", ""weight"", ""reduce"", ""small"", ""number"", ""regularly"", ""use"", ""fast"", ""vomiting"", ""laxative"", ""appetite"", ""suppressant"", ""direction"", ""weight"", ""modification"", ""girl"", ""boy"", ""conform"", ""stereotyped"", ""physical"", ""ideal"", ""rate"", ""weight"", ""reduce"", ""female"", ""high"", ""school"", ""adolescent"", ""increase"", ""significantly"", ""since"", ""similar"", ""survey"", ""american"", ""youth"", ""20"", ""year"", ""ago""]",None,modification,None,Hispanic
"Latino, Asian, and black segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas: are multiethnic metros different?","This study examines 1990 residential segregation levels and 1980-1990 changes in segregation for Latinos, Asians, and blacks in U.S. metropolitan areas. It also evaluates the effect of emerging multiethnic metropolitan area contexts for these segregation patterns. While black segregation levels are still well above those for Latinos and Asians, there is some trend toward convergence over the decade. More than half of the areas increased their Latino segregation levels over the 1980s, and almost three-fourths increased their Asian segregation levels. In contrast, black segregation levels decreased in 88% of metropolitan areas. Multiethnic metropolitan area context is shown to be important for internal segregation dynamics. Black segregation levels are lower, and were more likely to decline in multiethnic metropolitan areas and when other minority groups grew faster than blacks. Latino segregation was also more likely to decline in such areas, and declines in both Latino and Asian segregation were greater when other minority groups were growing.

LGB racial and ethnic minority adults (N = 208; Mage = 27.52, SD = 8.76), including 104 (50%) men, 93 (44.7%) women, and 11 (5.3%) other gender/ungendered, participated in an online survey. In terms of sexual orientation, 44 (21.2%) identified as lesbian, 90 (43.3%) identified as gay, 51 (24.5%) identified as bisexual women, 16 (7.7%) identified as bisexual men, and seven (3.4%) identified as bisexual gender/ungendered. In terms of race and ethnicity, 46 (22.1%) identified as African American, 49 (23.6%) identified as Asian American, 65 (31.3%) identified as Latinx, 6 (2.9%) identified as Native American, and 42 (20.2%) identified as being of other race/ethnicity or of mixed race. LGB identity commitment was associated with lower levels of depression, and CIA was associated with higher levels of depression. LGB identity commitment moderated the association between CIA and depression such that CIA was associated positively with depression among participants who reported low levels of LGB identity commitment, but this relation was nonsignificant among participants who reported high levels of LGB identity commitment.

"Distinguishing the geographic levels and social dimensions of U.S. metropolitan segregation, 1960-2000.","In this article, we assess trends in residential segregation in the United States from 1960 to 2000 along several dimensions of race and ethnicity, class, and life cycle and present a method for attributing segregation to nested geographic levels. We measured segregation for metropolitan America using the Theil index, which is additively decomposed into contributions of regional, metropolitan, center city-suburban, place, and tract segregation. This procedure distinguishes whether groups live apart because members cluster in different neighborhoods, communities, metropolitan areas, or regions. Substantively, we found that the segregation of blacks decreased considerably after 1960 largely because neighborhoods became more integrated, but the foreign born became more segregated largely because they concentrated in particular metropolitan areas. Class segregation increased between 1970 and 1990 mainly because the affluent increasingly clustered in specific metropolitan areas and in specific municipalities within metropolitan areas.

The Disproportionate Burden of COVID-19 Cases among Arab Americans.,"Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 cases are pervasive. Some minority, immigrant, and marginalized groups, such as Arab Americans, have been excluded from the research. This population confronts barriers to health care, discrimination, and other factors that may affect understanding, testing, and treatment as it relates to COVID-19. Arab Americans are unique compared to Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and Asians because Arab Americans do not have a specific ethnic identifier and are classified as non-Hispanic white. Given these issues, this study will estimate COVID-19 cases and examine associations among Arab Americans compared to Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Asian adults. Data from the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (March 2020-July 2021), the American Community Survey (2015-2019), and an Arab/Chaldean surname algorithm were used. Chi-square tests were used to determine statistically significant differences between groups. Logistic regression was used to estimate age-adjusted and sex-stratified proportions among Arab Americans compared to non-Hispanic whites before and after adjusting for age and sex. Approximately 17% of Arab Americans tested positive for COVID-19 compared to 11.32% of Hispanics, 9.80% of non-Hispanic blacks, 7.50% of non-Hispanic whites, and 4.24% of Asians. Arab Americans had 2.63 (95% CI: 2.59, 2.66) times greater odds of testing positive for COVID-19 compared to non-Hispanic whites. When Arab Americans were disaggregated from non-Hispanic whites, alarming patterns in COVID-19 cases were observed for Arab Americans.

"Color-blind racial ideology: theory, training, and measurement implications in psychology.","Synthesizing the interdisciplinary literature, we characterize color-blind racial ideology (CBRI) as consisting of two interrelated domains: color-evasion (i.e., denial of racial differences by emphasizing sameness) and power-evasion (i.e., denial of racism by emphasizing equal opportunities). Mounting empirical data suggest that the color-evasion dimension is ineffective and in fact promotes interracial tension and potential inequality. CBRI may be conceived as an ultramodern or contemporary form of racism and a legitimizing ideology used to justify the racial status quo. Four types of CBRI are described: denial of (a) race, (b) blatant racial issues, (c) institutional racism, and (d) White privilege.

Implications of the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory on ethnic differences in IQ.,"The Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence and the Spearman-Jensen hypothesis were applied to help interpret mean IQ differences among ethnic groups. The Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory classifies cognitive abilities on three strata, which differ by magnitude of generality including specific, broad, and general abilities. The Spearman-Jensen hypothesis advances the belief that mean IQ differences between African Americans and Euro-Americans occur as a function of the test's g loadings. Although IQ differences between African Americans and Euro-Americans occur, the differences should be larger on tests with higher g loadings and smaller on tests with lower g loadings. The analysis described in this paper may serve as the catalyst to encourage all intelligence test publishers to supply test users with data regarding mean IQ differences among various ethnic groups.",Psychological reports,"[""cattell"", ""horn"", ""carroll"", ""theory"", ""intelligence"", ""spearman"", ""jensen"", ""hypothesis"", ""apply"", ""help"", ""interpret"", ""mean"", ""iq"", ""difference"", ""among"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""cattell"", ""horn"", ""carroll"", ""theory"", ""classify"", ""cognitive"", ""ability"", ""three"", ""stratum"", ""differ"", ""magnitude"", ""generality"", ""include"", ""specific"", ""broad"", ""general"", ""ability"", ""spearman"", ""jensen"", ""hypothesis"", ""advance"", ""belief"", ""mean"", ""iq"", ""difference"", ""african"", ""american"", ""euro"", ""american"", ""occur"", ""function"", ""test"", ""g"", ""loading"", ""although"", ""iq"", ""difference"", ""african"", ""american"", ""euro"", ""american"", ""occur"", ""difference"", ""large"", ""test"", ""high"", ""g"", ""loading"", ""small"", ""test"", ""low"", ""g"", ""loading"", ""analysis"", ""described"", ""paper"", ""may"", ""serve"", ""catalyst"", ""encourage"", ""intelligence"", ""test"", ""publisher"", ""supply"", ""test"", ""user"", ""datum"", ""regard"", ""mean"", ""iq"", ""difference"", ""among"", ""various"", ""ethnic"", ""group""]",None,None,None,None

Do Black and Hispanic children benefit more from preschool? Understanding differences in preschool effects across racial groups.,"Recent studies suggest that the effects of attending preschool vary by race. These findings are difficult to interpret because the likelihood of enrolling a child in preschool also differs across groups. This study used newly released, nationally representative data to examine whether the impact of preschool participation at age 4 varies across racial groups after accounting for selection differences (N = 7,400). Among a subsample of children living below a poverty threshold, no racial differences in preschool impact are detected.

Is doctor-patient race concordance associated with greater satisfaction with care?,"We examined a national sample of African American, white, Hispanic, and Asian American respondents to test the hypothesis that doctor-patient race concordance is predictive of patient satisfaction. Our analysis examined racial/ethnic differences in patient satisfaction among patients in multiple combinations of doctor-patient race/ethnicity pairs. Additionally, we outline the determinants of doctor-patient race concordance. The analysis used the 1994 Commonwealth Fund Minority Health Survey to construct a series of multivariate models. We found that for respondents in each race/ethnic group, patients who had a choice in the selection of their physician were more likely to be race concordant. Whites were more likely to be race concordant with their physician compared to African American, Hispanic, and Asian American respondents. Among each race/ethnic group, respondents who were race concordant reported greater satisfaction with their physician compared with respondents who were not race concordant.

Demographic and geographic variations in breast cancer mortality among U.S. Hispanics.,"This paper examines demographic and geographic differences in breast cancer mortality (1999 to 2009) between U.S. Hispanic and non-Hispanic women from different racial groups. Data were publically available from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Four racial groups are included: American Indian/Alaska Natives, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Blacks/African Americans, and Whites. Age-adjusted rates were obtained for women ages 35-64 and 65 years and older. Hispanic mortality was generally lower than non-Hispanic mortality regardless of age, race, Census Region, State, or county. The lone exception was Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islanders residing in Hawaii. Despite generally lower rates, there was considerable variation in Hispanic breast cancer mortality within the country. Poverty, percentage of renters, and educational attainment were important explanatory factors. Analytic epidemiologic studies might explain social, cultural, and other reasons for the observed geographic variations.

"Changes in medical care experiences of racial and ethnic groups in the United States, 1996-2002.","The authors examined changes in medical care experiences of racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic white, Asian and Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black) between 1996 and 2002, using data from the Household Component of Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys. Proportions and adjusted odds ratios for each group's primary care experience are presented. Comparisons are made between groups at each time period and within groups between the two time periods. Multivariable analyses control for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health care needs and source of care, and health insurance. Racial/ethnic minorities experienced worse medical care than non-Hispanic whites, but results differed among groups. Non-Hispanic blacks were no different from non-Hispanic whites and showed a slight improvement over time, except for lower odds of having a usual source of care and worse sociodemographic and health indicators. Hispanics had worse experiences than whites in 5 of 8 indicators in 2002 (vs. 3 in 1996). Asians assessed their experience as worse than that of whites in 6 of 8 indicators in 2002 (vs. 3 in 1996), yet had higher self-rated health and education than non-Hispanic whites.

The time is now: tackling racial and ethnic disparities in mental and behavioral health services in Massachusetts.,"Massachusetts is in the midst of a demographic shift that will leave the state with unprecedented ethnic, racial and cultural diversity. In light of this change, health care services in the Commonwealth need to respond to and serve an increasingly multicultural population. The time is now for bold initiatives to reduce behavioral health and health service disparities by building collaborations between policymakers, insurers/payers, provider organizations, training institutions, and community groups. In the same way collaboration among diverse stakeholders enabled the Commonwealth to lead the nation in achieving near universal access to health insurance, a new collaboration can pave the way for the elimination of behavioral health and health care disparities. This brief compiles current information on racial and ethnic disparities in mental health and substance use disorders and treatment disparities in Massachusetts. It concludes with state level policy recommendations. The Brief does not recommend policies already in motion, such as moving to universal insurance coverage, enforcement of parity laws, policies to expand coverage of drug treatment services or greater inclusion of consumers in the development and configuration of behavioral health services. Recommendations offered are based on best practices and evidence-based research. Most research, however, studies incremental changes. To transform rather than reform the system, we integrate consideration of experience and research from other policy areas. The ultimate goal is to generate an action plan that motivates policymakers to address persistent racial and ethnic disparities in the availability and quality of behavioral health services in the Commonwealth.",Issue brief (Massachusetts Health Policy Forum),"[""massachusett"", ""midst"", ""demographic"", ""shift"", ""leave"", ""state"", ""unprecedented"", ""ethnic"", ""racial"", ""cultural"", ""diversity"", ""light"", ""change"", ""health"", ""care"", ""service"", ""commonwealth"", ""need"", ""respond"", ""serve"", ""increasingly"", ""multicultural"", ""population"", ""time"", ""bold"", ""initiative"", ""reduce"", ""behavioral"", ""health"", ""health"", ""service"", ""disparity"", ""building"", ""collaboration"", ""policymaker"", ""insurer"", ""payer"", ""provider"", ""organization"", ""training"", ""institution"", ""community"", ""group"", ""way"", ""collaboration"", ""among"", ""diverse"", ""stakeholder"", ""enable"", ""commonwealth"", ""lead"", ""nation"", ""achieve"", ""near"", ""universal"", ""access"", ""health"", ""insurance"", ""new"", ""collaboration"", ""pave"", ""way"", ""elimination"", ""behavioral"", ""health"", ""health"", ""care"", ""disparity"", ""brief"", ""compile"", ""current"", ""information"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""substance"", ""use"", ""disorder"", ""treatment"", ""disparity"", ""massachusetts"", ""conclude"", ""state"", ""level"", ""policy"", ""recommendation"", ""brief"", ""recommend"", ""policy"", ""already"", ""motion"", ""move"", ""universal"", ""insurance"", ""coverage"", ""enforcement"", ""parity"", ""law"", ""policy"", ""expand"", ""coverage"", ""drug"", ""treatment"", ""service"", ""great"", ""inclusion"", ""consumer"", ""development"", ""configuration"", ""behavioral"", ""health"", ""service"", ""recommendation"", ""offer"", ""base"", ""good"", ""practice"", ""evidence"", ""based"", ""research"", ""research"", ""however"", ""study"", ""incremental"", ""change"", ""transform"", ""rather"", ""reform"", ""system"", ""integrate"", ""consideration"", ""experience"", ""research"", ""policy"", ""area"", ""ultimate"", ""goal"", ""generate"", ""action"", ""plan"", ""motivate"", ""policymaker"", ""address"", ""persistent"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""availability"", ""quality"", ""behavioral"", ""health"", ""service"", ""commonwealth""]",None,None,None,None
"Race Differences in Gastrostomy Tube Placement After Stroke in Majority-White, Minority-Serving, and Racially Integrated US Hospitals.","We sought to determine individual and system contributions to race disparities in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement after stroke.

Positive childhood experiences predict less psychopathology and stress in pregnant women with childhood adversity: A pilot study of the benevolent childhood experiences (BCEs) scale.,"This pilot study examined the psychometric properties of the Benevolent Childhood Experiences (BCEs) scale, a new instrument designed to assess positive early life experiences in adults with histories of childhood maltreatment and other adversities. A counterpart to the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) questionnaire, the BCEs was developed to be multiculturally-sensitive and applicable regardless of socioeconomic position, urban-rural background, or immigration status. Higher levels of BCEs were hypothesized to predict lower levels of psychopathology and stress beyond the effects of ACES in a sample of ethnically diverse, low-income pregnant women. BCEs were also expected to show adequate internal validity across racial/ethnic groups and test-retest stability from the prenatal to the postnatal period. Participants were 101 pregnant women (M=29.10years, SD=6.56, range=18-44; 37% Latina, 22% African-American, 20% White, 21% biracial/multiracial/other; 37% foreign-born, 26% Spanish-speaking) who completed the BCEs and ACEs scales; assessments of prenatal depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, perceived stress, and exposure to stressful life events (SLEs) during pregnancy; and demographic information. Higher levels of BCEs predicted less PTSD symptoms and SLEs, above and beyond ACEs. The BCEs showed excellent test-retest reliability, and mean levels were comparable across racial/ethnic and Spanish-English groups of women. Person-oriented analyses also showed that higher levels of BCEs offset the effects of ACEs on prenatal stress and psychopathology. The BCEs scale indexes promising promotive factors associated with lower trauma-related symptomatology and stress exposure during pregnancy and illuminates how favorable childhood experiences may counteract long-term effects of childhood adversity.",Child abuse & neglect,"[""pilot"", ""examine"", ""psychometric"", ""property"", ""benevolent"", ""childhood"", ""experience"", ""bce"", ""scale"", ""new"", ""instrument"", ""design"", ""assess"", ""positive"", ""early"", ""life"", ""experience"", ""adult"", ""history"", ""childhood"", ""maltreatment"", ""adversity"", ""counterpart"", ""adverse"", ""childhood"", ""experience"", ""ace"", ""questionnaire"", ""bce"", ""develop"", ""multiculturally"", ""sensitive"", ""applicable"", ""regardless"", ""socioeconomic"", ""position"", ""urban"", ""rural"", ""background"", ""immigration"", ""status"", ""high"", ""level"", ""bce"", ""hypothesize"", ""predict"", ""low"", ""level"", ""psychopathology"", ""stress"", ""beyond"", ""effect"", ""ace"", ""sample"", ""ethnically"", ""diverse"", ""low"", ""income"", ""pregnant"", ""woman"", ""bce"", ""also"", ""expect"", ""show"", ""adequate"", ""internal"", ""validity"", ""across"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""test"", ""retest"", ""stability"", ""prenatal"", ""postnatal"", ""period"", ""participant"", ""101"", ""pregnant"", ""woman"", ""29"", ""10year"", ""sd"", ""6"", ""56"", ""range"", ""18"", ""44"", ""37"", ""latina"", ""22"", ""african"", ""american"", ""20"", ""white"", ""21"", ""biracial"", ""multiracial"", ""37"", ""foreign"", ""bear"", ""26"", ""spanish"", ""speak"", ""complete"", ""bce"", ""ace"", ""scale"", ""assessment"", ""prenatal"", ""depression"", ""post"", ""traumatic"", ""stress"", ""disorder"", ""ptsd"", ""symptom"", ""perceive"", ""stress"", ""exposure"", ""stressful"", ""life"", ""event"", ""sle"", ""pregnancy"", ""demographic"", ""information"", ""high"", ""level"", ""bce"", ""predict"", ""less"", ""ptsd"", ""symptom"", ""sle"", ""beyond"", ""ace"", ""bce"", ""show"", ""excellent"", ""test"", ""retest"", ""reliability"", ""mean"", ""level"", ""comparable"", ""across"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""spanish"", ""english"", ""group"", ""woman"", ""person"", ""orient"", ""analysis"", ""also"", ""show"", ""high"", ""level"", ""bce"", ""offset"", ""effect"", ""ace"", ""prenatal"", ""stress"", ""psychopathology"", ""bce"", ""scale"", ""index"", ""promising"", ""promotive"", ""factor"", ""associate"", ""low"", ""trauma"", ""related"", ""symptomatology"", ""stress"", ""exposure"", ""pregnancy"", ""illuminate"", ""favorable"", ""childhood"", ""experience"", ""may"", ""counteract"", ""long"", ""term"", ""effect"", ""childhood"", ""adversity""]","depression, PTSD",None,None,None

Differences in diffusion of FDA antidepressant risk warnings across racial-ethnic groups.,"OBJECTIVE Numerous articles have identified that medical technologies diffuse more rapidly among non-Latino whites compared with other racial-ethnic groups. However, whether health risk warnings also diffuse differentially across racial-ethnic minority groups is uncertain. This study assessed racial-ethnic variation in children's antidepressant use before and after the 2004 black-box warning concerning risks of antidepressants for youths. METHODS Data consisted of responses for white, black, and Latino youths ages five through 17 from the 2002-2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (N=44,422). The dependent variable was any antidepressant use in the prior year. Independent variables were race-ethnicity, year, psychological impairment, income, insurance status, region, and parents' education level. Logistic regression models were used to assess antidepressant use conditional on race-ethnicity, time, interaction between race-ethnicity and time, need, socioeconomic status, and Institute of Medicine-concordant estimates of disparities in predicted antidepressant use before and after the warning. RESULTS The warnings affected antidepressant use differentially for whites, blacks, and Latinos. Usage rates among whites decreased from 3.3 to 2.1 percentage points between prewarning and postwarning, whereas usage rates remained steady among Latinos and increased among blacks. Findings were significant in multiple regression analyses, in which predictions were adjusted for need. CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that health safety information on antidepressant usage among children diffused faster among whites than nonwhites, suggesting the need to improve infrastructure for delivering important health messages to racial-ethnic minority populations.","Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)","[""objective"", ""numerous"", ""article"", ""identify"", ""medical"", ""technology"", ""diffuse"", ""rapidly"", ""among"", ""non"", ""latino"", ""white"", ""compare"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""however"", ""whether"", ""health"", ""risk"", ""warning"", ""also"", ""diffuse"", ""differentially"", ""across"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""group"", ""uncertain"", ""assess"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""variation"", ""child"", ""antidepressant"", ""use"", ""2004"", ""black"", ""box"", ""warn"", ""concern"", ""risk"", ""antidepressant"", ""youth"", ""method"", ""datum"", ""consist"", ""response"", ""white"", ""black"", ""latino"", ""youth"", ""age"", ""five"", ""17"", ""2002"", ""2008"", ""medical"", ""expenditure"", ""panel"", ""survey"", ""n"", ""44"", ""422"", ""dependent"", ""variable"", ""antidepressant"", ""use"", ""prior"", ""year"", ""independent"", ""variable"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""year"", ""psychological"", ""impairment"", ""income"", ""insurance"", ""status"", ""region"", ""parent"", ""education"", ""level"", ""logistic"", ""regression"", ""model"", ""use"", ""assess"", ""antidepressant"", ""use"", ""conditional"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""time"", ""interaction"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""time"", ""need"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""institute"", ""medicine"", ""concordant"", ""estimate"", ""disparity"", ""predict"", ""antidepressant"", ""use"", ""warning"", ""warning"", ""affect"", ""antidepressant"", ""use"", ""differentially"", ""white"", ""black"", ""latinos"", ""usage"", ""rate"", ""among"", ""white"", ""decrease"", ""3"", ""3"", ""2"", ""1"", ""percentage"", ""point"", ""prewarne"", ""postwarning"", ""whereas"", ""usage"", ""rate"", ""remain"", ""steady"", ""among"", ""latinos"", ""increase"", ""among"", ""black"", ""finding"", ""multiple"", ""regression"", ""analysis"", ""prediction"", ""adjust"", ""need"", ""conclusion"", ""finding"", ""indicate"", ""health"", ""safety"", ""information"", ""antidepressant"", ""usage"", ""among"", ""child"", ""diffuse"", ""fast"", ""among"", ""white"", ""nonwhite"", ""suggest"", ""need"", ""improve"", ""infrastructure"", ""deliver"", ""important"", ""health"", ""message"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""population""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,Latino

A population-based examination of racial and ethnic differences in receiving physicians' advice to quit smoking.,"We examined the rate of physician-delivered smoking cessation advice in the United States over time for five different racial/ethnic groups. We analyzed three waves (1992--1993, 1995--1996, 1998--1999) of population-based survey data (Tobacco Use Supplement of the Current Population Survey) to examine the relationship between a smoker's race/ethnicity and past-year receipt of physician-delivered smoking cessation advice. Results of a multivariate logistic regression showed no difference in the receipt of advice as a function of a smoker's race/ethnicity in any of the surveys, with the exception of 1998--1999, after controlling for factors such as smoker's gender, years of education, household income, and cigarettes smoked per day. In the 1998--1999 survey, Asian smokers were more likely to report receiving smoking cessation advice from a physician relative to non-Hispanic White smokers. With the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native smokers, the receipt of advice by each racial/ethnic group increased significantly from the 1992--1993 survey to the 1998--1999 survey, after controlling for gender, age, education, and cigarettes smoked per day.

Residential hierarchy in Los Angeles: an examination of ethnic and documentation status differences.,"Longitudinal event history data from two waves of the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey are used to explore racial, ethnic, and documentation status differences in access to desirable neighborhoods. We first find that contrary to recent findings, undocumented Latinos do not replace blacks at the bottom of the locational attainment hierarchy. Whites continue to end up in neighborhoods that are less poor and whiter than minority groups, while all minorities, including undocumented Latinos, end up in neighborhoods that are of similar quality. Second, the effects of socioeconomic status for undocumented Latinos are either similar to or weaker than disadvantaged blacks. These findings suggest that living in less desirable neighborhoods is a fate disproportionately borne by non-white Los Angeles residents and that in some limited ways, the penalty attached to being undocumented Latino might actually be greater than the penalty attached to being black.",Social science research,"[""longitudinal"", ""event"", ""history"", ""data"", ""two"", ""wave"", ""los"", ""angeles"", ""family"", ""neighborhood"", ""survey"", ""use"", ""explore"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""documentation"", ""status"", ""difference"", ""access"", ""desirable"", ""neighborhood"", ""first"", ""find"", ""contrary"", ""recent"", ""finding"", ""undocumented"", ""latinos"", ""replace"", ""black"", ""bottom"", ""locational"", ""attainment"", ""hierarchy"", ""white"", ""continue"", ""end"", ""neighborhood"", ""less"", ""poor"", ""whiter"", ""minority"", ""group"", ""minority"", ""include"", ""undocumented"", ""latinos"", ""end"", ""neighborhood"", ""similar"", ""quality"", ""second"", ""effect"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""undocumented"", ""latinos"", ""either"", ""similar"", ""weak"", ""disadvantaged"", ""black"", ""finding"", ""suggest"", ""live"", ""less"", ""desirable"", ""neighborhood"", ""fate"", ""disproportionately"", ""bear"", ""non"", ""white"", ""los"", ""angeles"", ""resident"", ""limited"", ""way"", ""penalty"", ""attach"", ""undocumented"", ""latino"", ""might"", ""actually"", ""great"", ""penalty"", ""attach"", ""black""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,Latino

Of 21 participants, 16 reported engaging in past-year disordered eating or weight and shape control behaviors, including binge eating, fasting, vomiting, and laxative use. Study participants described using a variety of strategies to address body image concerns in the context of gender-related and other discriminatory experiences, which shaped participants' access to social and material resources as well as stress and coping behaviors. Disordered weight and shape control behaviors were discussed in relation to four emergent themes: (1) gender socialization and the development of femininity ideals, (2) experiences of stigma and discrimination, (3) biological processes, and (4) multi-level sources of strength and resilience.

Cannabis use disorders are comparatively prevalent among nonwhite racial/ethnic groups and adolescents: a national study.,"The racial/ethnic composition of the US population is shifting, with the nonwhite population growing faster than whites. We examined cannabis use disorder (CUD) prevalences and correlates in seven racial/ethnic groups. We included cannabis use (CU) prevalence as a comparison. Data were from the 2005-2011 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (N = 394,400). Substance use among respondents aged ≥12 years was assessed by computer-assisted, self-interviewing methods. The following were included as control variables: age, sex, family income, government assistance, county type, residential stability, major depressive episode history, arrest history, nicotine dependence, alcohol disorder, and survey year. Past-year CU prevalence increased significantly from 10.45% in 2005 to 11.41-11.54% during 2009-2011. Compared with whites, mixed-race individuals had higher odds of CU; Asian Americans and Hispanics had lower odds of CU. There were no significant yearly changes in CUD prevalence in the sample during 2005-2011 (1.58-1.73%). Compared with whites, individuals who were mixed-race, black, and Native American had higher odds of CUD; Asian Americans had lower odds. In aggregate, 15.35% of past-year cannabis users met criteria for a CUD in the 12-month period. Past-year cannabis users who were black, Native American, Hispanic, or Asian American had higher odds of CUD than white users. In each racial/ethnic group, adolescent cannabis users generally showed greater odds of CUD than adult users. Behavioral health indicators (major depressive episode, arrest history, nicotine dependence, alcohol disorder) were associated with CU and CUD. In conclusion, CUD disproportionally affects nonwhite groups and youth.",Journal of psychiatric research,"[""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""composition"", ""we"", ""population"", ""shift"", ""nonwhite"", ""population"", ""grow"", ""fast"", ""white"", ""examine"", ""cannabis"", ""use"", ""disorder"", ""cud"", ""prevalence"", ""correlate"", ""seven"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""include"", ""cannabis"", ""use"", ""cu"", ""prevalence"", ""comparison"", ""datum"", ""2005"", ""2011"", ""national"", ""survey"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""health"", ""n"", ""394"", ""400"", ""substance"", ""use"", ""among"", ""respondent"", ""aged"", ""12"", ""year"", ""assess"", ""computer"", ""assist"", ""self"", ""interviewing"", ""method"", ""follow"", ""include"", ""variable"", ""age"", ""sex"", ""family"", ""income"", ""government"", ""assistance"", ""county"", ""type"", ""residential"", ""stability"", ""major"", ""depressive"", ""episode"", ""history"", ""arrest"", ""history"", ""nicotine"", ""dependence"", ""alcohol"", ""disorder"", ""survey"", ""year"", ""past"", ""year"", ""cu"", ""prevalence"", ""increase"", ""significantly"", ""10"", ""45"", ""2005"", ""11"", ""41"", ""11"", ""54"", ""2009"", ""2011"", ""compare"", ""white"", ""mixed"", ""race"", ""individual"", ""high"", ""odd"", ""cu"", ""asian"", ""american"", ""hispanic"", ""low"", ""odd"", ""cu"", ""yearly"", ""change"", ""cud"", ""prevalence"", ""sample"", ""2005"", ""2011"", ""1"", ""58"", ""1"", ""73"", ""compare"", ""white"", ""individual"", ""mixed"", ""race"", ""black"", ""native"", ""american"", ""high"", ""odd"", ""cud"", ""asian"", ""american"", ""low"", ""odd"", ""aggregate"", ""15"", ""35"", ""past"", ""year"", ""cannabis"", ""user"", ""meet"", ""criterion"", ""cud"", ""12"", ""month"", ""period"", ""past"", ""year"", ""cannabis"", ""user"", ""black"", ""native"", ""american"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""american"", ""high"", ""odd"", ""cud"", ""white"", ""user"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""adolescent"", ""cannabis"", ""user"", ""generally"", ""show"", ""great"", ""odd"", ""cud"", ""adult"", ""user"", ""behavioral"", ""health"", ""indicator"", ""major"", ""depressive"", ""episode"", ""arrest"", ""history"", ""nicotine"", ""dependence"", ""alcohol"", ""disorder"", ""associate"", ""cu"", ""cud"", ""conclusion"", ""cud"", ""disproportionally"", ""affect"", ""nonwhite"", ""group"", ""youth""]",None,None,None,"Asian, Native American, Hispanic"

Ecological momentary assessment of the snacking environments of children from racially/ethnically diverse households.,"Children consume nearly one-third of their daily energy intake as snacks (i.e., eating occasions that occur between meals); thus there is a growing interest in understanding what snacking occasions look like in the homes of young children. This study makes use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to 1) examine differences in the contextual factors, including location, food preparation style, people present, presence of media devices, and overall atmosphere, between meal and snack occasions; and 2) explore differences in the context of snacking occasions across children's gender and weight status. Data for the current study came from the Family Matters Study, which included 150 families with children aged 5-7 years old (n = 25 from each of the following groups: Black/African American, Hispanic, Hmong, Native American, Somali, White). Parents completed an 8-day EMA observation period, during which they were surveyed after each eating occasion with the study child; questions explored contextual factors including location, food preparation style, people present, presence of media devices, and the overall atmosphere of each eating occasion. Differences between meals and snacks were observed; a smaller percentage of snacks (compared to meals) were prepared by the parent, consisted of only homemade food, and were planned ahead of time, as opposed to being served in response to a child's request. Snacks were more likely than other meals to be eaten on the couch and in the presence of a screen. Furthermore, important differences in snacking context were observed by child gender and weight status. Findings illuminate opportunities to improve children's overall dietary intake via interventions focused on improving the quality of foods served during snacks, as well as the contextual environment in which snacks are eaten.",Appetite,"[""child"", ""consume"", ""nearly"", ""one"", ""third"", ""daily"", ""energy"", ""intake"", ""snack"", ""e"", ""eating"", ""occasion"", ""occur"", ""meal"", ""thus"", ""grow"", ""interest"", ""understand"", ""snacking"", ""occasion"", ""look"", ""like"", ""home"", ""young"", ""child"", ""make"", ""use"", ""ecological"", ""momentary"", ""assessment"", ""ema"", ""1"", ""examine"", ""difference"", ""contextual"", ""factor"", ""include"", ""location"", ""food"", ""preparation"", ""style"", ""people"", ""present"", ""presence"", ""medium"", ""device"", ""overall"", ""atmosphere"", ""meal"", ""snack"", ""occasion"", ""2"", ""explore"", ""difference"", ""context"", ""snacking"", ""occasion"", ""across"", ""child"", ""gender"", ""weight"", ""status"", ""data"", ""current"", ""come"", ""family"", ""matter"", ""include"", ""150"", ""family"", ""child"", ""aged"", ""5"", ""7"", ""year"", ""old"", ""n"", ""25"", ""follow"", ""group"", ""black"", ""african"", ""american"", ""hispanic"", ""hmong"", ""native"", ""american"", ""somali"", ""white"", ""parent"", ""complete"", ""8"", ""day"", ""ema"", ""observation"", ""period"", ""survey"", ""eat"", ""occasion"", ""child"", ""question"", ""explore"", ""contextual"", ""factor"", ""include"", ""location"", ""food"", ""preparation"", ""style"", ""people"", ""present"", ""presence"", ""medium"", ""device"", ""overall"", ""atmosphere"", ""eating"", ""occasion"", ""difference"", ""meal"", ""snack"", ""observe"", ""small"", ""percentage"", ""snack"", ""compare"", ""meal"", ""prepare"", ""parent"", ""consist"", ""homemade"", ""food"", ""plan"", ""ahead"", ""time"", ""oppose"", ""served"", ""response"", ""child"", ""request"", ""snack"", ""likely"", ""meal"", ""eat"", ""couch"", ""presence"", ""screen"", ""furthermore"", ""important"", ""difference"", ""snacking"", ""context"", ""observe"", ""child"", ""gender"", ""weight"", ""status"", ""finding"", ""illuminate"", ""opportunity"", ""improve"", ""child"", ""overall"", ""dietary"", ""intake"", ""via"", ""intervention"", ""focus"", ""improve"", ""quality"", ""food"", ""serve"", ""snack"", ""well"", ""contextual"", ""environment"", ""snack"", ""eat""]",None,None,None,"Black, Native American, Hispanic"

Frequency of the cholesteryl ester storage disease common LIPA E8SJM mutation (c.894G>A) in various racial and ethnic groups.,"Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) and Wolman disease are autosomal recessive later-onset and severe infantile disorders, respectively, which result from the deficient activity of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). LAL is encoded by LIPA (10q23.31) and the most common mutation associated with CESD is an exon 8 splice junction mutation (c.894G>A; E8SJM), which expresses only ∼3%-5% of normally spliced LAL. However, the frequency of c.894G>A is unknown in most populations. To estimate the prevalence of CESD in different populations, the frequencies of the c.894G>A mutation were determined in 10,000 LIPA alleles from healthy African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and Ashkenazi Jewish individuals from the greater New York metropolitan area and 6,578 LIPA alleles from African-American, Caucasian, and Hispanic subjects enrolled in the Dallas Heart Study. The combined c.894G>A allele frequencies from the two cohorts ranged from 0.0005 (Asian) to 0.0017 (Caucasian and Hispanic), which translated to carrier frequencies of 1 in 1,000 to ∼1 in 300, respectively. No African-American heterozygotes were detected. Additionally, by surveying the available literature, c.894G>A was estimated to account for 60% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 51%-69%) of reported mutations among multiethnic CESD patients. Using this estimate, the predicted prevalence of CESD in the Caucasian and Hispanic populations is ∼0.8 per 100,000 (∼1 in 130,000; 95% CI: ∼1 in 90,000 to 1 in 170,000).","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)","[""cholesteryl"", ""ester"", ""storage"", ""disease"", ""cesd"", ""wolman"", ""disease"", ""autosomal"", ""recessive"", ""later"", ""onset"", ""severe"", ""infantile"", ""disorder"", ""respectively"", ""result"", ""deficient"", ""activity"", ""lysosomal"", ""acid"", ""lipase"", ""lal"", ""lal"", ""encode"", ""lipa"", ""10q23"", ""31"", ""common"", ""mutation"", ""associated"", ""cesd"", ""exon"", ""8"", ""splice"", ""junction"", ""mutation"", ""c"", ""894"", ""g"", ""e8sjm"", ""express"", ""3"", ""5"", ""normally"", ""splice"", ""lal"", ""however"", ""frequency"", ""c"", ""894"", ""g"", ""unknown"", ""population"", ""estimate"", ""prevalence"", ""cesd"", ""different"", ""population"", ""frequency"", ""c"", ""894"", ""g"", ""mutation"", ""determine"", ""10"", ""000"", ""lipa"", ""allele"", ""healthy"", ""african"", ""american"", ""asian"", ""caucasian"", ""hispanic"", ""ashkenazi"", ""jewish"", ""individual"", ""great"", ""new"", ""york"", ""metropolitan"", ""area"", ""6"", ""578"", ""lipa"", ""allele"", ""african"", ""american"", ""caucasian"", ""hispanic"", ""subject"", ""enrol"", ""dallas"", ""heart"", ""combined"", ""c"", ""894"", ""g"", ""allele"", ""frequency"", ""two"", ""cohort"", ""range"", ""0"", ""0005"", ""asian"", ""0"", ""0017"", ""caucasian"", ""hispanic"", ""translate"", ""carrier"", ""frequency"", ""1"", ""1"", ""000"", ""1"", ""300"", ""respectively"", ""african"", ""american"", ""heterozygote"", ""detect"", ""additionally"", ""survey"", ""available"", ""literature"", ""c"", ""894"", ""g"", ""estimate"", ""account"", ""60"", ""95"", ""confidence"", ""interval"", ""ci"", ""51"", ""69"", ""report"", ""mutation"", ""among"", ""multiethnic"", ""cesd"", ""patient"", ""use"", ""estimate"", ""predict"", ""prevalence"", ""cesd"", ""caucasian"", ""hispanic"", ""population"", ""0"", ""8"", ""per"", ""100"", ""000"", ""1"", ""130"", ""000"", ""95"", ""ci"", ""1"", ""90"", ""000"", ""1"", ""170"", ""000""]",None,None,None,"Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic"

"Race, Hispanic origin, and socioeconomic status in relation to motor vehicle occupant death rates and risk factors among adults.","Black and Hispanic adults travel less in motor vehicles than whites but may be at greater risk when they do travel. Passenger vehicle occupant deaths per 10 million trips among persons ages 25-64 were computed by race, Hispanic origin, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES) using 1995 data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) and Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey. Educational level was used as the indicator of SES. Blacks, particularly black men, were at increased risk of dying relative to whites when traveling in motor vehicles (rate ratio (RR) for black men=1.48; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.42-1.54). Hispanic men, but not Hispanic women, also had elevated occupant death rates, but their risk was less than that of black men (RR=1.26; 95% CI=1.20-1.31). SES was the strongest determinant of occupant deaths per unit of travel; RRs among those who had not completed high school were 3.52 (95% CI=3.39-3.65) for men and 2.79 (95% CI=2.69-2.91) for women, respectively. Whites without high school degrees had the highest death rates per 10 million trips. After adjustment for SES, the elevated risk of occupant fatalities persisted among black men and women, but not among Hispanic men. Seat belt use and alcohol-impaired driving were examined among fatally injured passenger vehicle drivers. Among those with no education beyond high school, higher percentages were reported as having high blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) or having not used belts. Reported belt use rates were lower among black men and women, even after controlling for SES, whereas Hispanic men and women had belt use rates similar to those of whites. High BACs were more common among Hispanic men, which appeared largely to be an effect of SES because most Hispanic men killed in crashes had not completed high school, the education level with the highest percentage that drove while impaired by alcohol. More effective public health efforts are needed to reduce occupant deaths among persons of lower SES, blacks, and Hispanics, including measures to increase use of seat belts and reduce alcohol-impaired driving.",Accident; analysis and prevention,"[""black"", ""hispanic"", ""adult"", ""travel"", ""less"", ""motor"", ""vehicle"", ""white"", ""may"", ""great"", ""risk"", ""travel"", ""passenger"", ""vehicle"", ""occupant"", ""death"", ""per"", ""10"", ""million"", ""trip"", ""among"", ""person"", ""age"", ""25"", ""64"", ""computed"", ""race"", ""hispanic"", ""origin"", ""gender"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""se"", ""use"", ""1995"", ""datum"", ""fatality"", ""analysis"", ""reporting"", ""system"", ""far"", ""nationwide"", ""personal"", ""transportation"", ""survey"", ""educational"", ""level"", ""use"", ""indicator"", ""se"", ""black"", ""particularly"", ""black"", ""man"", ""increase"", ""risk"", ""die"", ""relative"", ""white"", ""travel"", ""motor"", ""vehicle"", ""rate"", ""ratio"", ""rr"", ""black"", ""man"", ""1"", ""48"", ""95"", ""confidence"", ""interval"", ""ci"", ""1"", ""42"", ""1"", ""54"", ""hispanic"", ""man"", ""hispanic"", ""woman"", ""also"", ""elevate"", ""occupant"", ""death"", ""rate"", ""risk"", ""less"", ""black"", ""man"", ""rr"", ""1"", ""26"", ""95"", ""ci"", ""1"", ""20"", ""1"", ""31"", ""se"", ""strong"", ""determinant"", ""occupant"", ""death"", ""per"", ""unit"", ""travel"", ""rrs"", ""among"", ""complete"", ""high"", ""school"", ""3"", ""52"", ""95"", ""ci"", ""3"", ""39"", ""3"", ""65"", ""man"", ""2"", ""79"", ""95"", ""ci"", ""2"", ""69"", ""2"", ""91"", ""woman"", ""respectively"", ""white"", ""without"", ""high"", ""school"", ""degree"", ""high"", ""death"", ""rate"", ""per"", ""10"", ""million"", ""trip"", ""adjustment"", ""se"", ""elevated"", ""risk"", ""occupant"", ""fatality"", ""persist"", ""among"", ""black"", ""man"", ""woman"", ""among"", ""hispanic"", ""man"", ""seat"", ""belt"", ""use"", ""alcohol"", ""impaired"", ""driving"", ""examine"", ""among"", ""fatally"", ""injure"", ""passenger"", ""vehicle"", ""driver"", ""among"", ""education"", ""beyond"", ""high"", ""school"", ""high"", ""percentage"", ""report"", ""high"", ""blood"", ""alcohol"", ""concentration"", ""bac"", ""use"", ""belt"", ""report"", ""belt"", ""use"", ""rate"", ""low"", ""among"", ""black"", ""man"", ""woman"", ""even"", ""control"", ""se"", ""whereas"", ""hispanic"", ""man"", ""woman"", ""belt"", ""use"", ""rate"", ""similar"", ""white"", ""high"", ""bacs"", ""common"", ""among"", ""hispanic"", ""man"", ""appear"", ""largely"", ""effect"", ""ses"", ""hispanic"", ""man"", ""kill"", ""crash"", ""complete"", ""high"", ""school"", ""education"", ""level"", ""high"", ""percentage"", ""drive"", ""impaired"", ""alcohol"", ""effective"", ""public"", ""health"", ""effort"", ""need"", ""reduce"", ""occupant"", ""death"", ""among"", ""person"", ""low"", ""se"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""include"", ""measure"", ""increase"", ""use"", ""seat"", ""belt"", ""reduce"", ""alcohol"", ""impaired"", ""driving""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,"Black, Hispanic"

We determined the total number of persons in the United States by race/ethnicity who began treatment during 1995 to 2005 for ESRD and for ESRD with diabetes or hypertension as the primary diagnosis. Incidence rates were calculated by using census data and age-adjusted based on the 2000 US standard population. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze trends. Overall, during 1995 to 2005, the age-adjusted ESRD incidence increased from 260.7 per million to 350.9 per million, but the rate of increase slowed from 1998 to 2005. In the 2000s, compared with the 1990s, the age-adjusted ESRD incidence has continued to increase but at a slower rate among whites and blacks and has decreased significantly among Native Americans, Asians, and Hispanics.

This study aims to determine the differences in race and ethnicity reporting between HD and birth certificate (BC) data for maternity hospitals in Florida and to estimate the impact of race and ethnicity misclassification on state- and hospital-specific SMM rates. We conducted a population-based retrospective study of live births using linked BC and HD records from 2016 to 2019 (<i>n</i> = 783,753). BC data were used as the gold standard. Race and ethnicity were categorized as non-Hispanic (NH)-White, NH-Black, Hispanic, NH-Asian Pacific Islander (API), and NH-American Indian or Alaskan Native (AIAN). Overall, race and ethnicity misclassification and its impact on SMM at the state- and hospital levels were estimated. At the state level, NH-AIAN women were the most misclassified (sensitivity: 28.2%; positive predictive value (PPV): 25.2%) and were commonly classified as NH-API (30.3%) in HD records. NH-API women were the next most misclassified (sensitivity: 57.3%; PPV: 85.4%) and were commonly classified as NH-White (5.8%) or NH-other (5.5%). At the hospital level, wide variation in sensitivity and PPV with negative skewing was identified, particularly for NH-White, Hispanic, and NH-API women. Misclassification did not result in large differences in SMM rates at the state level for all race and ethnicity categories except for NH-AIAN women (% difference 78.7). However, at the hospital level, Hispanic women had wide variability of a percent difference in SMM rates and were more likely to have underestimated SMM rates. Reducing race and ethnicity misclassification on HD records is key in assessing and addressing SMM differences and better informing surveillance, research, and quality improvement efforts.",International journal of environmental research and public health,"[""hospital"", ""discharge"", ""hd"", ""record"", ""contain"", ""important"", ""information"", ""use"", ""public"", ""health"", ""health"", ""care"", ""sector"", ""become"", ""increasingly"", ""common"", ""rely"", ""mostly"", ""exclusively"", ""hd"", ""datum"", ""assess"", ""monitor"", ""severe"", ""maternal"", ""morbidity"", ""smm"", ""overall"", ""sociodemographic"", ""characteristic"", ""include"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""limited"", ""study"", ""validate"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""hd"", ""provide"", ""estimate"", ""impact"", ""assess"", ""health"", ""difference"", ""maternity"", ""population"", ""aim"", ""determine"", ""difference"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""reporting"", ""hd"", ""birth"", ""certificate"", ""bc"", ""datum"", ""maternity"", ""hospital"", ""florida"", ""estimate"", ""impact"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""misclassification"", ""state"", ""hospital"", ""specific"", ""smm"", ""rate"", ""conduct"", ""population"", ""base"", ""retrospective"", ""live"", ""birth"", ""use"", ""link"", ""bc"", ""hd"", ""record"", ""2016"", ""2019"", ""n"", ""783"", ""753"", ""bc"", ""datum"", ""use"", ""gold"", ""standard"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""categorize"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""nh"", ""white"", ""nh"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""nh"", ""asian"", ""pacific"", ""islander"", ""api"", ""nh"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""alaskan"", ""native"", ""aian"", ""overall"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""misclassification"", ""impact"", ""smm"", ""state"", ""hospital"", ""level"", ""estimate"", ""state"", ""level"", ""nh"", ""aian"", ""woman"", ""misclassifie"", ""sensitivity"", ""28"", ""2"", ""positive"", ""predictive"", ""value"", ""ppv"", ""25"", ""2"", ""commonly"", ""classify"", ""nh"", ""api"", ""30"", ""3"", ""hd"", ""record"", ""nh"", ""api"", ""woman"", ""next"", ""misclassified"", ""sensitivity"", ""57"", ""3"", ""ppv"", ""85"", ""4"", ""commonly"", ""classify"", ""nh"", ""white"", ""5"", ""8"", ""nh"", ""5"", ""5"", ""hospital"", ""level"", ""wide"", ""variation"", ""sensitivity"", ""ppv"", ""negative"", ""skewing"", ""identify"", ""particularly"", ""nh"", ""white"", ""hispanic"", ""nh"", ""api"", ""woman"", ""misclassification"", ""result"", ""large"", ""difference"", ""smm"", ""rate"", ""state"", ""level"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""category"", ""except"", ""nh"", ""aian"", ""woman"", ""difference"", ""78"", ""7"", ""however"", ""hospital"", ""level"", ""hispanic"", ""woman"", ""wide"", ""variability"", ""percent"", ""difference"", ""smm"", ""rate"", ""likely"", ""underestimate"", ""smm"", ""rate"", ""reduce"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""misclassification"", ""hd"", ""record"", ""key"", ""assess"", ""address"", ""smm"", ""difference"", ""well"", ""inform"", ""surveillance"", ""research"", ""quality"", ""improvement"", ""effort""]",None,None,None,"Black, Asian, Hispanic"
Ethnic/racial differences in the prevalence of injurious spanking and other child physical abuse in a National Survey of Adolescents.,"Limited research has examined whether similar patterns in injurious spanking and other forms of child physical abuse (CPA) exist across specific ethnic/racial groups. The authors examined and compared differences in the lifetime prevalence of injurious spanking and CPA in two national samples of adolescents across ethnic/racial groups and over time. Participants were 4,023 youth (12-17 years) and 3,614 youth (12-17 years) who participated in the 1995 National Survey of Adolescents (NSA) and 2005 National Survey of Adolescents-Replication (NSA-R), respectively. Adolescents, who were identified through random digit dial procedures, completed a telephone interview assessment. Results indicated significant ethnic/racial variation across groups in reports of injurious spanking in the NSA and the NSA-R samples; however, significant differences were not observed within groups between the two samples over time. Ethnic/racial differences also were found between groups in reports of CPA in the NSA-R sample.

Racial microaggressions and major discriminatory events explain ethnoracial differences in psychotic experiences.,"Few empirical studies have examined whether exposure to major racial discrimination explains ethnoracial disparities in psychosis outcomes and none to our knowledge have done so in the U.S. or have examined the role of other forms of racism such as racial microaggressions. The present study examined ethnoracial differences in self-reported psychotic experiences (PE) among 955 college students in an urban environment in the Northeastern U.S., and the degree to which major experiences of racial discrimination and racial microaggressions explains ethnoracial differences in PE. Mean scores on self-report inventories of PE and distressing PE (i.e., Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ)), major experiences of racial discrimination (EOD), and racial and ethnic microaggressions (REMS) were compared across 4 ethnoracial groups (White, Black, Asian, and Latina/o). Results from parallel mediation linear regression models adjusted for immigrant status, age, gender, and family poverty using the Hayes PROCESS application indicated ethnoracial differences in PE were explained independently by both forms of racism. Specifically, Black young people reported higher mean levels of PE, and distressing PE than both White and Latina/o people and the difference in PE between Black and White and Black and Latino/a young people was significantly explained by both greater exposure to racial microaggressions and major racial discriminatory experiences among Black people. This study re-emphasizes the explanatory role of racism, in its multiple forms, for psychosis risk among Black young populations in the US.

Women's misconceptions about cancer screening: implications for informed decision-making.,"Informed decision-making about cancer screening requires that patients have a correct understanding of a test's purpose, benefits, and risks. Misconceptions, however, may be common. Semi-structured interviews were carried out and thematically coded using a purposive sample of 24 socioeconomically diverse white, African American, Latino and Chinese American women recruited from general medicine practices and community settings. Interviews focused on participants ideas related to cancer prevention and screening. Women expressed cancer-related beliefs characterized by inaccuracies, distortions, and over-simplifications. Many of these beliefs may go unrecognized in clinical settings yet have a profound influence on risk communication and, therefore, informed decision-making.

Legal mobilization in schools: the paradox of rights and race among youth.,"In this article, we analyze ethnoracial patterns in youth perceptions and responses to rights violations and advance a new model of legal mobilization that includes formal, quasi-, and extralegal action. Slightly more than half of the 5,461 students in our sample reported past rights violations involving discrimination, harassment, freedom of expression/assembly, and due process violations in disciplinary procedures. Students, regardless of race, are more likely to take extralegal than formal legal actions in response to perceived rights violations. Self-identified African American and Latino/a students are significantly more likely than white and Asian American students to perceive rights violations and are more likely to claim they would take formal legal action in response to hypothetical rights violations. However, when they perceive rights violations, African American and Asian American students are no more likely than whites to take formal legal action and Latino/a students are less likely than whites to take formal legal action.

"Neighborhood racial/ethnic concentration, social disadvantage, and homicide risk: an ecological analysis of 10 U.S. cities.","Homicide is one of the leading causes of death among African-American and Hispanic men. We investigated how neighborhood characteristics associated with social disadvantage explain racial/ethnic homicide gaps in 10 U.S. cities. The test hypotheses were that (1) higher concentrations of African-Americans and Hispanics would be associated with higher homicide rates and (2) the relationship between racial/ethnic concentration and homicide would be attenuated after adjusting for neighborhood characteristics (e.g., unemployment, median household income, low educational attainment, and female headship). The test hypotheses were examined using separate Poisson regression models, which adjusted for spatial autocorrelation. Homicide rates were greater in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of African-Americans and Hispanics than in other groups, and the association of neighborhood racial/ethnic concentration with homicide was reduced after adjusting for neighborhood social disadvantage variables, especially percent female head of household and percent persons with less than a high school education. We also found that the relationship between neighborhood racial/ethnic concentration and homicide was explained more by social disadvantage variables in some cities than in others.

Keeping hope alive: Racial-ethnic disparities in distress tolerance are mitigated by religious/spiritual hope among Black Americans.,"Racial and ethnic minorities, including Blacks/African-Americans and Hispanics/Latinos,indicate lower tolerance to psychological distress (DT) and secular hope yet endorse more religious and spiritual hope than their non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts. Whether racial-ethnic minorities derive greater benefit from non-secular hope on the tolerance of psychological distress remains unclear. Self-reported endorsement of religious/spiritual (R/S) hope, secular hope, DT, and a number of other psychosocial, R/S and sociodemographic variables were analyzed from a nationwide survey of persons aged over 18 years (N = 2875) identifying as Black (14.2%), Hispanic (15.4%), or NHW (67.3%) using multiple regression. Overall, higher levels of both R/S and secular hope predicted greater DT. In turn, greater DT was associated with lower psychosomatic distress. Compared to NHW, the ethnic-minority groups reported lower overall levels of DT. An interaction for race-ethnicity further revealed that compared to distress intolerant NHW, Blacks/African-Americans at lower levels of DT report higher R/S and secular hope. Hispanics/Latinos were also higher on R/S and secular hope, but endorsed lower hope at higher levels of DT than the reference group. Although hope is considered a more passive form of coping, it is more frequently endorsed in marginalized ethnic-minority groups. However, compared to NHW, differences do exist in the extent to which R/S hope mitigates DT in Blacks/African-Americans compared to Hispanics/Latinos.",Journal of psychosomatic research,"[""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""include"", ""black"", ""african"", ""american"", ""hispanic"", ""latino"", ""indicate"", ""low"", ""tolerance"", ""psychological"", ""distress"", ""dt"", ""secular"", ""hope"", ""yet"", ""endorse"", ""religious"", ""spiritual"", ""hope"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""nhw"", ""counterpart"", ""whether"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""derive"", ""great"", ""benefit"", ""non"", ""secular"", ""hope"", ""tolerance"", ""psychological"", ""distress"", ""remain"", ""unclear"", ""self"", ""report"", ""endorsement"", ""religious"", ""spiritual"", ""r"", ""hope"", ""secular"", ""hope"", ""dt"", ""number"", ""psychosocial"", ""r"", ""sociodemographic"", ""variable"", ""analyze"", ""nationwide"", ""survey"", ""person"", ""aged"", ""18"", ""year"", ""n"", ""2875"", ""identify"", ""black"", ""14"", ""2"", ""hispanic"", ""15"", ""4"", ""nhw"", ""67"", ""3"", ""use"", ""multiple"", ""regression"", ""overall"", ""high"", ""level"", ""r"", ""secular"", ""hope"", ""predict"", ""great"", ""dt"", ""turn"", ""great"", ""dt"", ""associate"", ""low"", ""psychosomatic"", ""distress"", ""compared"", ""nhw"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""group"", ""report"", ""low"", ""overall"", ""level"", ""dt"", ""interaction"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""reveal"", ""compare"", ""distress"", ""intolerant"", ""nhw"", ""black"", ""african"", ""american"", ""low"", ""level"", ""dt"", ""report"", ""high"", ""r"", ""secular"", ""hope"", ""hispanic"", ""latinos"", ""also"", ""high"", ""r"", ""secular"", ""hope"", ""endorse"", ""low"", ""hope"", ""high"", ""level"", ""dt"", ""reference"", ""group"", ""although"", ""hope"", ""consider"", ""passive"", ""form"", ""cope"", ""frequently"", ""endorse"", ""marginalized"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""group"", ""however"", ""compare"", ""nhw"", ""difference"", ""exist"", ""extent"", ""r"", ""hope"", ""mitigate"", ""dt"", ""black"", ""african"", ""american"", ""compare"", ""hispanic"", ""latinos""]",None,None,None,"Black, Latino, Hispanic"

The multigroup ethnic identity measure-revised: measurement invariance across racial and ethnic groups.,"The Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure-Revised (MEIM-R), a brief instrument assessing affiliation with one's ethnic group, is a promising advance in the ethnic identity literature. However, equivalency of its measurement properties across specific racial and ethnic groups should be confirmed before using it in diverse samples. We examined (a) the psychometric properties of the MEIM-R, including factor structure, measurement invariance, and internal consistency reliability, and (b) levels of and differences in ethnic identity across multiple racial and ethnic groups and subgroups. Asian (n = 630), Black/African American (n = 58), Hispanic (n = 240), multiethnic (n = 160), and White (n = 375) women completed the MEIM-R as part of the ""Gestational diabetes' Effect on Moms"" diabetes prevention trial in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care setting (N = 1,463; M age = 32.5 years, SD = 4.9). Multiple-groups confirmatory factor analyses provided provisional evidence of measurement invariance, i.e., an equal, correlated 2-factor structure, equal factor loadings, and equal item intercepts across racial and ethnic groups. Latent factor means for the 2 MEIM-R subscales, exploration and commitment, differed across groups; effect sizes ranging from small to large generally supported the notion of ethnic identity as more salient among people of color. Pending replication, good psychometric properties in this large and diverse sample of women support the future use of the MEIM-R.

Multiculturalism and subjective happiness as mediated by cultural and relational variables.,"A diverse ethnic context and an increasing immigrant youth population will soon become the reality across the entire U.S. demographic landscape. Research has suggested that a multicultural context positively influences ethnic minority and immigrant youth by fostering ethnic identity and psychosocial development. However, it is unknown whether and how perceived multiculturalism can affect positive youth outcomes such as life satisfaction and subjective happiness. This study explored perceived school multiculturalism among 338 ethnic minority and immigrant youth, and found a positive relation between perceived school multiculturalism and subjective happiness with full mediation by ethnocultural empathy for African Americans, Asians, males, and females.

The Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire across four ethnoracial groups in an undergraduate sample.,"Increasing awareness of cross-cultural issues in psychology has led many to question the validity and utility of instruments in nonmajority ethnic and racial groups. The Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire (MASQ; Clark & Watson, 1991) is a widely used measure of anxious and depressive symptoms. However, some of the most-cited investigations into the psychometric properties of the MASQ have failed to report the demographics of their samples. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the psychometric properties of the MASQ across ethnoracial groups. Results suggest that the internal consistency and convergent and divergent validity of the MASQ are similar across ethnoracial groups. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis indicated cross-racial invariance of loadings on the General Distress and Anxious Arousal factors, although noninvariance was observed for the Anhedonic Depression.

"Beyond black, white and Hispanic: race, ethnic origin and drinking patterns in the United States.","This study used data on 42,862 U.S. adults, including 18,352 past-year drinkers, to describe differentials by race and national origin in U.S. drinking patterns. Age-sex standardized estimates were presented within 21 categories of ethnic origin for whites and within five categories each for individuals of black and other races. Of the three racial groups, whites were the most likely to drink, but blacks had the highest volume of intake and frequency of heavy drinking. Differences by ethnic origin within racial categories were as marked as differentials between races. Compared to whites of European origin, those of Hispanic and native American origin were less likely to drink but consumed more alcohol on days when they drank. Whites of Southern and Eastern European origin drank proportionately more wine and demonstrated more moderate drinking patterns (lower intake per drinking day and/or less frequent heavy drinking) than those of Northern or Central European origin. Hispanics of Caribbean origin were less prone to heavy drinking than other white Hispanics; similarly, blacks from the English-speaking Caribbean showed more moderate drinking patterns than other blacks. Individuals of Asian origin, in particular those of non-Japanese origin, had the most moderate drinking patterns within the category of other race. Although the black/white differentials in volume of intake and frequency of heavy drinking disappeared after adjusting for marital status, education and income, most of the differences by ethnic origin retained their statistical significance if not their original magnitudes. These findings indicate that cultural forces exert a strong effect on drinking behavior. Differences among European whites with respect to prevalence of drinking, beverage preference and frequency of heavy drinking suggest that the association between ethnic origin and drinking behavior may persist even after many generations of presumed acculturation.",Journal of substance abuse,"[""use"", ""datum"", ""42"", ""862"", ""u"", ""adult"", ""include"", ""18"", ""352"", ""past"", ""year"", ""drinker"", ""describe"", ""differential"", ""race"", ""national"", ""origin"", ""u"", ""drinking"", ""pattern"", ""age"", ""sex"", ""standardized"", ""estimate"", ""present"", ""within"", ""21"", ""category"", ""ethnic"", ""origin"", ""white"", ""within"", ""five"", ""category"", ""individual"", ""black"", ""race"", ""three"", ""racial"", ""group"", ""white"", ""likely"", ""drink"", ""black"", ""high"", ""volume"", ""intake"", ""frequency"", ""heavy"", ""drinking"", ""difference"", ""ethnic"", ""origin"", ""within"", ""racial"", ""category"", ""marked"", ""differential"", ""race"", ""compare"", ""white"", ""european"", ""origin"", ""hispanic"", ""native"", ""american"", ""origin"", ""less"", ""likely"", ""drink"", ""consume"", ""alcohol"", ""day"", ""drank"", ""white"", ""southern"", ""eastern"", ""european"", ""origin"", ""drink"", ""proportionately"", ""wine"", ""demonstrate"", ""moderate"", ""drinking"", ""pattern"", ""low"", ""intake"", ""per"", ""drinking"", ""day"", ""less"", ""frequent"", ""heavy"", ""drinking"", ""northern"", ""central"", ""european"", ""origin"", ""hispanic"", ""caribbean"", ""origin"", ""less"", ""prone"", ""heavy"", ""drinking"", ""white"", ""hispanic"", ""similarly"", ""black"", ""english"", ""speak"", ""caribbean"", ""show"", ""moderate"", ""drinking"", ""pattern"", ""black"", ""individual"", ""asian"", ""origin"", ""particular"", ""non"", ""japanese"", ""origin"", ""moderate"", ""drinking"", ""pattern"", ""within"", ""category"", ""race"", ""although"", ""black"", ""white"", ""differential"", ""volume"", ""intake"", ""frequency"", ""heavy"", ""drinking"", ""disappear"", ""adjust"", ""marital"", ""status"", ""education"", ""income"", ""difference"", ""ethnic"", ""origin"", ""retain"", ""statistical"", ""significance"", ""original"", ""magnitude"", ""finding"", ""indicate"", ""cultural"", ""force"", ""exert"", ""strong"", ""effect"", ""drinking"", ""behavior"", ""difference"", ""among"", ""european"", ""white"", ""respect"", ""prevalence"", ""drinking"", ""beverage"", ""preference"", ""frequency"", ""heavy"", ""drinking"", ""suggest"", ""association"", ""ethnic"", ""origin"", ""drinking"", ""behavior"", ""may"", ""persist"", ""even"", ""many"", ""generation"", ""presume"", ""acculturation""]",None,None,None,"Asian, Hispanic"

The role of ethnic identity and self-construal in coping among African American and Caucasian American seventh graders: an exploratory analysis of within-group variance.,"Much coping research has been conducted comparing members of different ethnic groups using discrete racial classifications. However, the past two decades have seen the construct of ethnicity evolve into a complex variable that must be assessed in a more comprehensive way. This study explored how ethnicity, a discrete variable, and the continuous variables of a person's ethnic identity and self-construal contribute to the use of particular coping strategies across various situations. One hundred twelve seventh graders (67 African Americans and 45 Caucasian Americans) from three suburban middle schools completed questionnaires assessing ethnic identity, self-construal, and coping strategies for medical, test, and social criticism stressors. Results supported the hypothesis that ethnicity as a discrete variable is not associated with coping, but that ethnic identity and self-construal are. It was also found that high scores on the ethnic identity and self-construal scales were indicative of more positive psychological adjustment.

"Assessment of the influence of food attributes on meal choice selection by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity among women living in Chicago, USA: A discrete choice experiment.","Large and persistent obesity disparities exist in the US by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity, and weight loss interventions have traditionally been less effective in these populations. Thus, a better understanding is needed of the behavioral, economic, and geographic factors that influence obesity risk factors such as eating behaviors. We used a discrete choice experiment to evaluate the impact of different meal attributes on meal choice and to test whether the relative importance of these attributes varied by SES and race/ethnicity. Study participants (n = 228) were given a series of 10 choice tasks and asked to choose among 4 meals, each rated based on the following attributes: taste; healthfulness; preparation time; travel time to food outlet for meal/ingredients; and price. SES was measured using education and self-reported difficulty paying for basics. Race/ethnicity was categorized as Hispanic/Latina, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic other. Data were analyzed using mixed logit regression models with interaction terms to determine whether meal attributes influenced meal choices differentially by SES and race/ethnicity. Healthfulness and taste were the most important attributes for all participants. Price was a more important attribute among those in the lowest SES group compared with those in the higher SES groups. Travel was the least important attribute for low SES participants, and it was not significantly related to meal choice in these groups. Discrete choice experiments as illustrated here may help pinpoint the most salient targets for interventions to improve eating behaviors and reduce obesity disparities.

The impact of race on organ donation authorization discussed in the context of liver transplantation.,"Inadequate organ donation limits transplantation for many in need of a life-saving organ. Race of donor families and requesting coordinators may impact the authorization rate for organ donation. We evaluated authorization rates for organ donation within the New York Organ Donor Network by race during 2009 and 2010. The donation authorization rate varied considerably according to the race of the donor. The authorization rate was 57% for Hispanic, 53% for Caucasian, 48% for African-American, and 23% for Asian donor families.

Satisfaction with Care and Attention to Age-Specific Concerns by Race and Ethnicity in a National Sample of Young Women with Breast Cancer.,"<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> In light of disparities in breast cancer care and outcomes, we explored whether attention to fertility, genetic, and emotional health concerns, as well as satisfaction with care, differs by race/ethnicity among young breast cancer patients. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The Young and Strong Study was a cluster randomized trial of an intervention for patients and providers at 54 U.S. oncology practices enrolling women diagnosed with breast cancer at ≤45 years of age. Provider attention to fertility, genetics, and emotional health was evaluated by medical record review. The proportions of patients with attention to these concerns were compared by race/ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black [NHB], Asian, non-Hispanic White [NHW], or multiracial/other). Satisfaction with care was assessed with the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-18 (PSQ-18) at 3 months, with median scores for each of 7 PSQ-18 subscales (general satisfaction, interpersonal manner, communication, financial, time spent with doctor, accessibility, and technical quality) compared by race/ethnicity. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Among 465 patients, median age at diagnosis was 40; 6% were Hispanic, 11% NHB, 4% were Asian, 75% NHW, and 3% multiracial/other. Provider attention to genetics, emotional health, and fertility did not differ by race/ethnicity. Median PSQ-18 scores did not differ by race/ethnicity, with median subscale scores ranging from 3.0 to 4.5 across groups, indicating high levels of satisfaction. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Satisfaction with care and provider attention to age-specific concerns were similar across racial/ethnic groups among young patients enrolled in an educational and supportive care intervention study. These data suggest that high-quality, equitable care is feasible. Further care delivery research is warranted in more diverse patient and practice settings.

There were no significant differences in beliefs between the African-Americans and the White Americans. The beliefs of the Hispanics and the Native Americans were most distinctive, but the differences were small in magnitude. Across race/ethnicity, the associations between beliefs and service use were generally weak and statistically insignificant.

Challenging conventional wisdom about who quits: revelations from corporate America.,"Findings from 20 corporations from the Attrition and Retention Consortium, which collects quit statistics about 475,458 professionals and managers, extended and disputed established findings about who quits.

Further, women quit more than men, while African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans quit more than White Americans, though racial differences disappeared after confounds were controlled for. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American women quit more than men of the same ethnicities and White Americans, but statistical controls nullified evidence for dual discrimination toward minority women.

Associations of organic produce consumption with socioeconomic status and the local food environment: Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).,"Neighborhood characteristics, such as healthy food availability, have been associated with consumption of healthy food. Little is known about the influence of the local food environment on other dietary choices, such as the decision to consume organic food. We analyzed the associations between organic produce consumption and demographic, socioeconomic and neighborhood characteristics in 4,064 participants aged 53-94 in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis using log-binomial regression models. Participants were classified as consuming organic produce if they reported eating organic fruits and vegetables either ""sometimes"" or ""often or always"". Women were 21% more likely to consume organic produce than men (confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-1.30), and the likelihood of organic produce consumption was 13% less with each additional 10 years of age (CI: 0.84-0.91). Participants with higher education were significantly more likely to consume organic produce (prevalence ratios [PR] were 1.05 with a high school education, 1.39 with a bachelor's degree and 1.68 with a graduate degree, with less than high school as the reference group [1.00]). Per capita household income was marginally associated with produce consumption (p = 0.06), with the highest income category more likely to consume organic produce. After adjustment for these individual factors, organic produce consumption was significantly associated with self-reported assessment of neighborhood produce availability (PR: 1.07, CI: 1.02-1.11), with an aggregated measure of community perception of the local food environment (PR: 1.08, CI: 1.00-1.17), and, to a lesser degree, with supermarket density (PR: 1.02: CI: 0.99-1.05).

Purpose and Character Development in Early Adolescence.,"Character development in adolescence is of growing interest among psychology researchers and educators, yet there is little consensus about how character should be defined and studied among developmental scientists. In particular, there is no fully developed framework for investigating the developmental relationships among different character strengths. This study examines the developmental relations between purpose and three other key character strengths that emerge during early adolescence: gratitude, compassion, and grit. We analyzed survey (n = 1005, 50.1% female, 24.1% Caucasian, 43.6% African American, 18.9% Hispanic, 11.9% Asian American) and interview (n = 98) data from a longitudinal study of character development among middle school students from the United States. Data were collected over the course of 2 years, with surveys conducted four times at 6-month intervals and interviews conducted twice at 12-month intervals. Data analyses showed small but significant correlations between purpose and each of the other three character strengths under investigation. Interview data revealed patterns in ways that adolescents acted on their purposeful aspirations; and interview analyses identified qualitative differences in expressions of gratitude and compassion between adolescents who were fully purposeful and those who were not.

"Socioeconomic disparities in colorectal cancer mortality in the United States, 1990-2007.","United States colorectal cancer mortality rates have declined; however, disparities by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity persist. The objective of this study was to describe the temporal association between colorectal cancer mortality and socioeconomic status by sex and race/ethnicity. Cancer mortality rates in the United States from 1990 to 2007, which were generated by the National Center for Health Statistics, and county-level socioeconomic status, which was estimated as the proportion of county residents living below the national poverty line based on 1990 US Census Bureau data, were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. The Kunst-Mackenbach relative index of inequality, which considers data across all poverty levels when comparing risks in the poorest (≥ 20%) and richest counties (<10%), was calculated as the measure of association. The study found that colorectal cancer mortality rates were significantly lower in the poorest counties than the richest counties during 1990-1992 among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic black women and non-Hispanic API men. Over time though the tendency was for the poorest counties to have higher mortality rates. By 2003-2007 colorectal cancer mortality rates were significantly higher in the poorest than the richest counties among all sex-race/ethnicity groups. This disparity was most noticeable and appeared to be increasing most among Hispanic men. This suggests that socioeconomic disparities in colorectal cancer mortality were apparent after stratifying by sex and race/ethnicity and reversed over time.

Racial and Ethnic Disparity in Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common and disabling psychiatric disorders in the USA. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are extremely important to prevent disability and improve quality of life. Recent studies have demonstrated racial and ethnic disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of MDD. African Americans (AA), Hispanics, and Asian Americans were significantly less likely to receive a depression diagnosis from a health-care provider than were non-Hispanic whites. The underdiagnosis of MDD in minority groups may be due to differences in socioeconomic status (SES), care affordability, cultural beliefs about depression, help-seeking patterns, access to culturally and linguistically appropriate care, patient-physician relationship, clinical presentation of depression, etc. Meanwhile, the likelihood of both having access to and receiving adequate care for depression was significantly low for AA, Hispanics, and Asian Americans, in contrast to whites. Similar disparities also exist in treatment outcomes. Besides the reasons for MDD underdiagnosis, additional contributing factors include access barriers to preferred mode of treatment, cultural concerns about antidepressants and different metabolism of antidepressants, etc. There are many ways to address these disparities and improve MDD care in minority populations, including universal depression screening, public financial incentives to ensure access to care in low-income and minority neighborhoods, quality improvement programs, cultural competency of mental health professionals, collaborative care management, community engagement and planning, and enhanced participation of minorities in clinical research.",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,"[""major"", ""depressive"", ""disorder"", ""mdd"", ""one"", ""common"", ""disable"", ""psychiatric"", ""disorder"", ""usa"", ""early"", ""diagnosis"", ""appropriate"", ""treatment"", ""extremely"", ""important"", ""prevent"", ""disability"", ""improve"", ""quality"", ""life"", ""recent"", ""study"", ""demonstrate"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""diagnosis"", ""treatment"", ""mdd"", ""african"", ""american"", ""aa"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""american"", ""significantly"", ""less"", ""likely"", ""receive"", ""depression"", ""diagnosis"", ""health"", ""care"", ""provider"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""underdiagnosis"", ""mdd"", ""minority"", ""group"", ""may"", ""due"", ""difference"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""ses"", ""care"", ""affordability"", ""cultural"", ""belief"", ""depression"", ""help"", ""seek"", ""pattern"", ""access"", ""culturally"", ""linguistically"", ""appropriate"", ""care"", ""patient"", ""physician"", ""relationship"", ""clinical"", ""presentation"", ""depression"", ""etc"", ""meanwhile"", ""likelihood"", ""access"", ""receive"", ""adequate"", ""care"", ""depression"", ""significantly"", ""low"", ""aa"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""american"", ""contrast"", ""white"", ""similar"", ""disparity"", ""also"", ""exist"", ""treatment"", ""outcome"", ""besides"", ""reason"", ""mdd"", ""underdiagnosis"", ""additional"", ""contribute"", ""factor"", ""include"", ""access"", ""barrier"", ""preferred"", ""mode"", ""treatment"", ""cultural"", ""concern"", ""antidepressant"", ""different"", ""metabolism"", ""antidepressant"", ""etc"", ""many"", ""way"", ""address"", ""disparity"", ""improve"", ""mdd"", ""care"", ""minority"", ""population"", ""include"", ""universal"", ""depression"", ""screen"", ""public"", ""financial"", ""incentive"", ""ensure"", ""access"", ""care"", ""low"", ""income"", ""minority"", ""neighborhood"", ""quality"", ""improvement"", ""program"", ""cultural"", ""competency"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""professional"", ""collaborative"", ""care"", ""management"", ""community"", ""engagement"", ""planning"", ""enhance"", ""participation"", ""minority"", ""clinical"", ""research""]",depression,None,socioeconomic status,"Asian, Hispanic"
"Tuberculosis trends--United States, 2014.","In 2014, a total of 9,412 new tuberculosis (TB) cases were reported in the United States, with an incidence rate of 3.0* cases per 100,000 persons, a decrease of 2.2% from 2013. Although overall numbers of TB cases and rates continue to decline, the percentage decrease in rate is the smallest decrease in over a decade (1). This report summarizes provisional TB surveillance data reported to CDC's National Tuberculosis Surveillance System for 2014. TB cases and rates decreased among U.S.-born persons, and although the case rate also decreased among foreign-born persons, there was an increase in total number of cases among foreign-born persons. The rate among foreign-born persons in the United States in 2014 was 13.4 times higher than among U.S.-born persons. Racial/ethnic minorities continue to be disproportionately affected by TB within the United States. Asians continue to be the racial/ethnic group with the largest number of TB cases. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, the TB rate among Asians was 28.5 times higher, whereas rates among non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics were each eight times higher. Four states (California, Texas, New York, and Florida), representing approximately one third of the U.S. population, accounted for half of all TB cases reported in 2014.

"Business structure, ethnic shifts in labor markets, and violence: the link between company size, local labor markets, and non-Latino homicide.","Combining several schools of thought, including the civic engagement thesis, we extend current research by linking three things at the county level; firm size, the ethnic composition of labor markets, and violent crime. Our results suggest that larger businesses (based on the average number of persons employed) are more likely to have an external orientation and long recruitment reach, and this is linked to ethnic shifts in labor markets toward Latino workers. Such shifts are in turn associated with high rates of homicide among non-Latinos.

Regional and racial/ethnic variations in alcohol consumption among older adults.,"<b>Objectives</b>: This paper sought to examine the role of region and race/ethnicity in alcohol consumption among older adults. <b>Methods</b>: Data were obtained from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Participants aged 60 and older were included (<i>n</i> = 185, 190). Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were conducted to examine the effects of region and race/ethnicity on alcohol consumption among older adults. <b>Results</b>: Results indicate that region and race/ethnicity are significantly related to the alcohol consumption of older adults. More specifically, results suggest that White older adults consume significantly more alcohol than other racial/ethnic groups among older adults. Regarding regional effects, results suggest that older adults in the West consume significantly more alcohol than older adults in the Midwest and South. Additionally, results suggest regional variation in alcohol consumption patterns by race/ethnicity. <b>Conclusion</b>: Findings provide additional insight into how and where alcohol is being used among older adults in the United States.

"Understanding the breast cancer experience of women: a qualitative study of African American, Asian American, Latina and Caucasian cancer survivors.","Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in American women across most ethnic groups. Although the psychosocial impact of breast cancer is being studied, there is little information on women from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. We conducted a qualitative study with breast cancer survivors (BCS) of various ethnicities. A total of 102 BCS participated in focus group interviews (24 African Americans, 34 Asians, 26 Latinas and 18 Caucasians); 20 health professionals participated in key informant interviews. Important ethnic differences in type of treatment were noted, Asians and Latinas were more likely to receive mastectomies and African American BCS were least likely to receive adjuvant therapies, including radiation and chemotherapy. These BCS enjoyed a fairly good overall health-related quality of life (HRQOL) with some persistent concerns. The prevailing concerns among all women included overall health, moderate physical concerns, cancer recurrence or metastases, psychosocial concerns related to worry about children and burdening the family, and body image and sexual health concerns. Additional challenges included: lack of knowledge about breast cancer; medical care issues such as insurance, cost and amount of time spent with physician; cultural sensitivity of providers, language barriers, cultural factors related to beliefs about illness, gender role and family obligations (e.g. self-sacrifice). These BCS, particularly the women of color, voiced that their spiritual beliefs and practices are central to their coping. This study accomplishes two goals; it adds to the sparse literature concerning the psychosocial sequelae of breast cancer among women of color, and it increases our knowledge of specific cultural influences (e.g. dietary practices, coping) and socio-ecological factors on HRQOL. More importantly, the study addressed areas that have not been studied before, specifically, an in-depth study on BCS QOL comparing multiple ethnic groups in the US. The results of this investigation will provide preliminary information to survivors and health-care providers about the impact of culture and socio-ecological contexts on survivorship. Among women of all major ethnic groups, breast cancer is the most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death (American Cancer Society (ACS), 2002). In 2002, over 203,000 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer (ACS, 2002). Ethnic disparities exist for cancer stage, diagnosis, survival, morbidity and mortality. In general, ethnic minority women are diagnosed with more advanced disease and experience greater morbidity and mortality (Haynes & Smedley, 1999; Miller et al., 1996; Ries et al., 2000; Shinagawa, 2000). In general, increases in survival rates have prompted greater interest in the quality of life (QOL) of breast cancer survivors (BCS) over the past two decades. Additionally, the QOL of cancer survivors from diverse ethnic, cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds is an emerging priority area for studies on survivorship research and clinical care (Haynes and Smedley, 1999; National Cancer Institute (NCI), 2002; President's Cancer Panel, 2000).",Psycho-oncology,"[""breast"", ""cancer"", ""common"", ""form"", ""cancer"", ""american"", ""woman"", ""across"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""although"", ""psychosocial"", ""impact"", ""breast"", ""cancer"", ""study"", ""little"", ""information"", ""woman"", ""diverse"", ""ethnic"", ""socioeconomic"", ""background"", ""conduct"", ""qualitative"", ""breast"", ""cancer"", ""survivor"", ""bc"", ""various"", ""ethnicity"", ""total"", ""102"", ""bcs"", ""participate"", ""focus"", ""group"", ""interview"", ""24"", ""african"", ""american"", ""34"", ""asian"", ""26"", ""latina"", ""18"", ""caucasian"", ""20"", ""health"", ""professional"", ""participate"", ""key"", ""informant"", ""interview"", ""important"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""type"", ""treatment"", ""note"", ""asian"", ""latina"", ""likely"", ""receive"", ""mastectomy"", ""african"", ""american"", ""bcs"", ""least"", ""likely"", ""receive"", ""adjuvant"", ""therapy"", ""include"", ""radiation"", ""chemotherapy"", ""bcs"", ""enjoy"", ""fairly"", ""good"", ""overall"", ""health"", ""related"", ""quality"", ""life"", ""hrqol"", ""persistent"", ""concern"", ""prevail"", ""concern"", ""among"", ""woman"", ""include"", ""overall"", ""health"", ""moderate"", ""physical"", ""concern"", ""cancer"", ""recurrence"", ""metastasis"", ""psychosocial"", ""concern"", ""related"", ""worry"", ""child"", ""burden"", ""family"", ""body"", ""image"", ""sexual"", ""health"", ""concern"", ""additional"", ""challenge"", ""include"", ""lack"", ""knowledge"", ""breast"", ""cancer"", ""medical"", ""care"", ""issue"", ""insurance"", ""cost"", ""amount"", ""time"", ""spend"", ""physician"", ""cultural"", ""sensitivity"", ""provider"", ""language"", ""barrier"", ""cultural"", ""factor"", ""related"", ""belief"", ""illness"", ""gender"", ""role"", ""family"", ""obligation"", ""e"", ""g"", ""self"", ""sacrifice"", ""bcs"", ""particularly"", ""woman"", ""color"", ""voice"", ""spiritual"", ""belief"", ""practice"", ""central"", ""coping"", ""accomplish"", ""two"", ""goal"", ""add"", ""sparse"", ""literature"", ""concern"", ""psychosocial"", ""sequela"", ""breast"", ""cancer"", ""among"", ""woman"", ""color"", ""increase"", ""knowledge"", ""specific"", ""cultural"", ""influence"", ""e"", ""g"", ""dietary"", ""practice"", ""cope"", ""socio"", ""ecological"", ""factor"", ""hrqol"", ""importantly"", ""address"", ""area"", ""study"", ""specifically"", ""depth"", ""bcs"", ""qol"", ""compare"", ""multiple"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""we"", ""investigation"", ""provide"", ""preliminary"", ""information"", ""survivor"", ""health"", ""care"", ""provider"", ""impact"", ""culture"", ""socio"", ""ecological"", ""context"", ""survivorship"", ""among"", ""woman"", ""major"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""breast"", ""cancer"", ""common"", ""form"", ""cancer"", ""second"", ""leading"", ""cause"", ""cancer"", ""death"", ""american"", ""cancer"", ""society"", ""acs"", ""2002"", ""2002"", ""203"", ""000"", ""woman"", ""united"", ""state"", ""diagnose"", ""breast"", ""cancer"", ""acs"", ""2002"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""exist"", ""cancer"", ""stage"", ""diagnosis"", ""survival"", ""morbidity"", ""mortality"", ""general"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""woman"", ""diagnose"", ""advanced"", ""disease"", ""experience"", ""great"", ""morbidity"", ""mortality"", ""hayne"", ""smedley"", ""1999"", ""miller"", ""et"", ""al"", ""1996"", ""rie"", ""et"", ""al"", ""2000"", ""shinagawa"", ""2000"", ""general"", ""increase"", ""survival"", ""rate"", ""prompt"", ""great"", ""interest"", ""quality"", ""life"", ""qol"", ""breast"", ""cancer"", ""survivor"", ""bcs"", ""past"", ""two"", ""decade"", ""additionally"", ""qol"", ""cancer"", ""survivor"", ""diverse"", ""ethnic"", ""cultural"", ""socioeconomic"", ""background"", ""emerge"", ""priority"", ""area"", ""study"", ""survivorship"", ""research"", ""clinical"", ""care"", ""hayne"", ""smedley"", ""1999"", ""national"", ""cancer"", ""institute"", ""nci"", ""2002"", ""president"", ""cancer"", ""panel"", ""2000""]",None,None,None,"Caucasian, Asian"
Body Dissatisfaction in Early Adolescence: The Coactive Roles of Cognitive and Sociocultural Factors.,"The sociocultural influences of the media, friends, and family on body dissatisfaction in young girls are well documented, yet further increasing our comprehension of the coaction of cognitive processes with sociocultural factors is crucial to understanding the dynamic emergence of body dissatisfaction in early adolescence. The current study examined the roles of appearance related messages and expectations from friends and family and selective attention biases in the development of body dissatisfaction. An ethnically and racially diverse sample of girls (72 % Hispanic White, 17.8 % African-American, 8.5 % non-Hispanic White, and 1.7 % Asian-American) between the ages of 9 and 13 (N = 118) completed multiple measures of attention, sociocultural attitudes toward weight and shape, and body dissatisfaction. The data from these measures were examined using path analysis. The final model fit well, and demonstrated the coactive effect of selective attention and sociocultural factors on body dissatisfaction.

Attributions of Mental Illness: An Ethnically Diverse Community Perspective.,"Although the prevalence of mental illness is similar across ethnic groups, a large disparity exists in the utilization of services. Mental health attributions, causal beliefs regarding the etiology of mental illness, may contribute to this disparity.

We solicited attributions about 19 mental health disorders, each representing major sub-categories of the DSM-IV. Using a grounded theory approach, participant responses were categorized into 12 themes: Biological, Normalization, Personal Characteristic, Personal Choice, Just World, Spiritual, Family, Social Other, Environment, Trauma, Stress, and Diagnosis.

"Challenging Assumptions About Race/Ethnicity, Socioeconomic Status, and Cigarette Smoking Among Adolescents.","Previous research indicates that differences in cigarette smoking exist among those of different race/ethnicity and varying levels of socioeconomic status. However, most research has examined the influence of these factors separately on cigarette smoking despite their observed covariation.

Life course SES and cardiovascular risk: Heterogeneity across race/ethnicity and gender.,"We examine four life course models as they relate to adolescent SES, adult SES, and cardiovascular risk--the sensitive period, pathways, accumulation, and social mobility models. Accounting for race/ethnic and gender differences in life course processes, we analyzed Waves I and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a nationally representative sample of individuals enrolled in grades 7-12 when they were first interviewed in 1994/5. We restricted our sample to whites, blacks, and Latinos who were interviewed in Waves I and IV and provided biomarker data (n = 11,397). The cardiovascular risk score at Wave IV combined waist circumference, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and C-reactive protein. We found evidence for each of the four life course models for white women, whereas the sensitive period was indicated for white men. Upward mobility was also associated with higher CVD risk among white men as compared to those who were socio-economically advantaged at both time points. The pathway model was significant for Latino women. No life course models were significant for black men or women or Latino men.

The relationship between race/ethnicity and the perceived experience of mental health care.,"Although there is a vast amount of literature on differences in the perceived experiences of general health care among different racial/ethnic groups, few studies have examined the relationship between race/ethnicity and perceptions of mental health care. The purpose of this study was to determine whether non-Hispanic African Americans and Hispanics had more negative (or less positive) perceptions of the mental health treatment they receive compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Data were from the 1998-2006 Florida Health Services Surveys. The findings indicated that African Americans and Hispanics were less likely than Whites to have favorable perceptions of the mental health care services they received, even after adjusting for demographic and health status variables. Interventions should be designed to address disparities in mental health treatment and the perceptions of such treatment.

Cross-ethnic measurement invariance of the SCARED and CES-D in a youth sample.,"This study evaluated the cross-ethnic measurement invariance of 2 common screening measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms in youth. The measurement invariance of the Screen for Childhood Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was tested across 881 African American (Black; n = 396), Hispanic (n = 185), non-Hispanic White (White; n = 166), and Asian/Indian (n = 134) youth in the 7th grade. The measures were administered as part of a grade-wide screening to identify youth with elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms. The 5-factor model of the SCARED and the 4-factor model of the CES-D best represented the data for all ethnic groups. Results provided support for strong invariance of the SCARED across all 4 ethnic groups. Results provided support for strong invariance of the CES-D across Black, White, and Asian/Indian youth, and partial strong invariance for Hispanic youth. Overall, results suggest that factor means and total scores can be compared across groups. Factor mean differences across groups were identified for both measures. In particular, Hispanic youth reported greater levels of anxiety and depression in certain domains than White, Black, and Asian youth. Our findings support the use of the SCARED and CES-D as tools for measuring anxiety and depressive symptoms in ethnically diverse youth in the United States.

Dynamics of racial disparities in all-cause mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"As research documenting disparate impacts of COVID-19 by race and ethnicity grows, little attention has been given to dynamics in mortality disparities during the pandemic and whether changes in disparities persist. We estimate age-standardized monthly all-cause mortality in the United States from January 2018 through February 2022 for seven racial/ethnic populations. Using joinpoint regression, we quantify trends in race-specific rate ratios relative to non-Hispanic White mortality to examine the magnitude of pandemic-related shifts in mortality disparities. Prepandemic disparities were stable from January 2018 through February 2020. With the start of the pandemic, relative mortality disadvantages increased for American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN), Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (NHOPI), and Black individuals, and relative mortality advantages decreased for Asian and Hispanic groups. Rate ratios generally increased during COVID-19 surges, with different patterns in the summer 2021 and winter 2021/2022 surges, when disparities approached prepandemic levels for Asian and Black individuals. However, two populations below age 65 fared worse than White individuals during these surges. For AIAN people, the observed rate ratio reached 2.25 (95% CI = 2.14, 2.37) in October 2021 vs. a prepandemic mean of 1.74 (95% CI = 1.62, 1.86), and for NHOPI people, the observed rate ratio reached 2.12 (95% CI = 1.92, 2.33) in August 2021 vs. a prepandemic mean of 1.31 (95% CI = 1.13, 1.49).

Afro-Caribbean subgroups were more likely than Asian and Latino American subgroups to report perceived discrimination. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine which groups within the model were more likely to report chronic health conditions. Perceived discrimination was found to vary by race and was inversely associated with chronic respiratory conditions for Afro-Caribbeans.

Is neighborhood racial/ethnic composition associated with depressive symptoms? The multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis.,"The racial/ethnic composition of a neighborhood may be related to residents' depressive symptoms through differential levels of neighborhood social support and/or stressors. We used the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis to investigate cross-sectional associations of neighborhood racial/ethnic composition with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale in adults aged 45-84. The key exposure was a census-derived measure of the percentage of residents of the same racial/ethnic background in each participant's census tract. Two-level multilevel models were used to estimate associations of neighborhood racial/ethnic composition with CES-D scores after controlling for age, income, marital status, education and nativity. We found that living in a neighborhood with a higher percentage of residents of the same race/ethnicity was associated with increased CES-D scores in African American men (p < 0.05), and decreased CES-D scores in Hispanic men and women and Chinese women, although these differences were not statistically significant. Models were further adjusted for neighborhood-level covariates (social cohesion, safety, problems, aesthetic quality and socioeconomic factors) derived from survey responses and census data. Adjusting for other neighborhood characteristics strengthened protective associations amongst Hispanics, but did not change the significant associations in African American men. These results demonstrate heterogeneity in the associations of race/ethnic composition with mental health and the need for further exploration of which aspects of neighborhood environments may contribute to these associations.",Social science & medicine (1982),"[""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""composition"", ""neighborhood"", ""may"", ""related"", ""resident"", ""depressive"", ""symptom"", ""differential"", ""level"", ""neighborhood"", ""social"", ""support"", ""stressor"", ""use"", ""multi"", ""ethnic"", ""atherosclerosis"", ""investigate"", ""cross"", ""sectional"", ""association"", ""neighborhood"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""composition"", ""center"", ""epidemiologic"", ""study"", ""depression"", ""ces"", ""scale"", ""adult"", ""aged"", ""45"", ""84"", ""key"", ""exposure"", ""census"", ""derived"", ""measure"", ""percentage"", ""resident"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""background"", ""participant"", ""census"", ""tract"", ""two"", ""level"", ""multilevel"", ""model"", ""use"", ""estimate"", ""association"", ""neighborhood"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""composition"", ""ces"", ""score"", ""control"", ""age"", ""income"", ""marital"", ""status"", ""education"", ""nativity"", ""find"", ""live"", ""neighborhood"", ""high"", ""percentage"", ""resident"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""associate"", ""increase"", ""ces"", ""score"", ""african"", ""american"", ""man"", ""p"", ""0"", ""05"", ""decrease"", ""ces"", ""score"", ""hispanic"", ""man"", ""woman"", ""chinese"", ""woman"", ""although"", ""difference"", ""statistically"", ""model"", ""adjust"", ""neighborhood"", ""level"", ""covariate"", ""social"", ""cohesion"", ""safety"", ""problem"", ""aesthetic"", ""quality"", ""socioeconomic"", ""factor"", ""derive"", ""survey"", ""response"", ""census"", ""datum"", ""adjust"", ""neighborhood"", ""characteristic"", ""strengthen"", ""protective"", ""association"", ""amongst"", ""hispanic"", ""change"", ""association"", ""african"", ""american"", ""man"", ""demonstrate"", ""heterogeneity"", ""association"", ""race"", ""ethnic"", ""composition"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""need"", ""exploration"", ""aspect"", ""neighborhood"", ""environment"", ""may"", ""contribute"", ""association""]",None,None,None,Hispanic

The association between acculturation and hypertension in a multiethnic sample of US adults.,"Previous studies analyzing acculturation and cardiovascular risk were restricted to individual race/ethnic groups and did not fully account for potential confounders. We examined the independent association between acculturation and hypertension in a contemporary multiethnic sample that included white, black, Latino, and Asian individuals. We examined 51,048 participants in the 2007 California Health Interview Survey who were >18 years, 59.5% of whom were women. The main exposure-of-interest was acculturation score, a summary measure of the additive effect of 4 variables (country of birth, parents' country of birth, language at home, and duration of stay in the United States) ranged from 0 (least acculturation) to 4 (highest acculturation).

Anxiety sensitivity across four ethnoracial groups in an undergraduate sample.,"Anxiety sensitivity (AS), the fear of anxious cognitive and physiological experiences, is multidimensional and adds incrementally to the prediction of relationships of panic and relevant phenomenology. Many agree upon the content of the dimensions, but there is less agreement about the factor structure of the anxiety sensitivity index (ASI), a widely used measure of AS, across cultural groups. Anxiety disorders vary in their epidemiology and phenomenology across ethnoracial groups. This investigation adds clarity to research in the psychometric properties of the ASI across four cultural groups. Results from a confirmatory factor analysis support invariance across groups with the exception of three psychometrically questionable items assessing fear of gastrointestinal symptoms. The convergent and divergent validity are consistent with cross-group invariance as well.

The Effects of Health Disparities on Perceptions About Lung Cancer Screening (LCS): Survey Results of a Patient Sample.,"Lung cancer screening (LCS) is currently advocated in a subset of current or former smokers with a thirty pack-year smoking history or higher. Studies report that few patients meeting the criteria for screening are undergoing LCS. We conducted a survey to assess if barriers to LCS (race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status) affect the perceptions about LCS that could influence screening uptake.

"Contextual influences on polydrug use among young, low-income women: effects of neighborhood and personal networks.","This study assessed contextual risks for polydrug use in a triethnic sample (non-Hispanic white, African American, Hispanic) of young women with a low income. For the current analysis, a total of 712 young women aged 18 to 31 years who sought care in state-funded family planning clinics in southeast Texas from December 2001 to May 2003 participated in the survey. The main outcome of the study was the number of illicit drugs (including marijuana, MDMA [ecstasy], crack cocaine, and other hard drugs) used in the last 12 months. Of the 712 subjects, 198 (28%) reported using illicit drugs in the past 12 months. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was significantly associated with drug use in a bivariate model. The proportion of women living in the most advantaged neighborhoods who reported drug use was more than twice that of women living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods. However, the significance of neighborhood socioeconomic status was eliminated after controlling for ethnicity or for personal network characteristics in a multivariate ordinal logistic regression model. In contrast, in multivariate models, personal network indicators, such as a larger number of monthly contacts with friends (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11, 1.56) and a larger number of friends who used illicit drugs (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.33, 1.62) were associated with increased drug use. In addition, not being currently married (vs. being married) (OR = 2.73, 95% CI = 1.44, 5.16) was associated with a larger number of drugs used in the last 12 months. In conclusion, we found that neighborhood socioeconomic status was not directly associated with more drug use when controlling for ethnicity or for personal network characteristics. Personal networks may mediate the relationships between neighborhood and drug use. Strategies to reduce polydrug use should target personal networks where friends use illicit drugs.",The American journal on addictions,"[""assess"", ""contextual"", ""risk"", ""polydrug"", ""use"", ""triethnic"", ""sample"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""african"", ""american"", ""hispanic"", ""young"", ""woman"", ""low"", ""income"", ""current"", ""analysis"", ""total"", ""712"", ""young"", ""woman"", ""aged"", ""18"", ""31"", ""year"", ""seek"", ""care"", ""state"", ""fund"", ""family"", ""planning"", ""clinic"", ""southeast"", ""texas"", ""december"", ""2001"", ""may"", ""2003"", ""participate"", ""survey"", ""main"", ""outcome"", ""number"", ""illicit"", ""drug"", ""include"", ""marijuana"", ""mdma"", ""ecstasy"", ""crack"", ""cocaine"", ""hard"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""last"", ""12"", ""month"", ""712"", ""subject"", ""198"", ""28"", ""report"", ""use"", ""illicit"", ""drug"", ""past"", ""12"", ""month"", ""neighborhood"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""significantly"", ""associate"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""bivariate"", ""model"", ""proportion"", ""woman"", ""live"", ""advantaged"", ""neighborhood"", ""report"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""twice"", ""woman"", ""live"", ""disadvantaged"", ""neighborhood"", ""however"", ""significance"", ""neighborhood"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""eliminate"", ""control"", ""ethnicity"", ""personal"", ""network"", ""characteristic"", ""multivariate"", ""ordinal"", ""logistic"", ""regression"", ""model"", ""contrast"", ""multivariate"", ""model"", ""personal"", ""network"", ""indicator"", ""large"", ""number"", ""monthly"", ""contact"", ""friend"", ""odd"", ""ratio"", ""1"", ""32"", ""95"", ""confidence"", ""interval"", ""ci"", ""1"", ""11"", ""1"", ""56"", ""large"", ""number"", ""friend"", ""use"", ""illicit"", ""drug"", ""1"", ""47"", ""95"", ""ci"", ""1"", ""33"", ""1"", ""62"", ""associate"", ""increase"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""addition"", ""currently"", ""marry"", ""vs"", ""marry"", ""2"", ""73"", ""95"", ""ci"", ""1"", ""44"", ""5"", ""16"", ""associate"", ""large"", ""number"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""last"", ""12"", ""month"", ""conclusion"", ""find"", ""neighborhood"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""directly"", ""associate"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""control"", ""ethnicity"", ""personal"", ""network"", ""characteristic"", ""personal"", ""network"", ""may"", ""mediate"", ""relationship"", ""neighborhood"", ""drug"", ""use"", ""strategy"", ""reduce"", ""polydrug"", ""use"", ""target"", ""personal"", ""network"", ""friend"", ""use"", ""illicit"", ""drug""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,Hispanic
A locational analytics approach to COVID-19 discrimination and inequality against minorities across the United States.,"A major challenge in managing disasters during a pandemic is assessing the inequalities in society and protecting vulnerable people. The objective of this paper is to geographically understand the discrimination and inequality against minorities by COVID-19. This study designed a locational discrimination index (LDI) to measure COVID-19 discrimination against minorities at county-level in the US. LDI is the difference between the death proportion of a minority and the proportion of a minority's population. If LDI >0 is significant, COVID-19 discrimination is identified against a minority in a county. I further developed a locational minority inequality index (LMII), and LMII of a minority is directly quantified by comparing its LDI with the LDI of the majority population (i.e., the White population in the US). If LMII>0 is significant, a significant health inequality is confirmed against a minority in a county. In the US, I found 157 counties with significant discrimination against Black people, and 103 counties with significant inequality against Black people; 58 counties with significant discrimination against the American Indian population, but 38 counties with significant inequality against the American Indian population; 17 counties with significant discrimination against Native Hawaiians, but only 8 counties with significant inequality; for Hispanic people, 47 counties had significant discrimination, and 64 counties had significant inequality; for Asians, 7 counties had significant discrimination, but 28 had significant inequality. LDI, LMII, and the thematic mapping provide novel insight into COVID-19 discrimination and inequalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time anyone has quantitatively and statistically defined and mapped COVID-19 discrimination and inequality against minorities at a county-level across the US. Based on this, governments and communities could make efficient decisions and take effective action to addressthe significant discrimination and inequality against Black, American Indian, Native Hawaiian, Hispanic, and Asian people, which can be applied to other pandemics or public health disasters in the USA or other countries.",Social science & medicine (1982),"[""major"", ""challenge"", ""managing"", ""disaster"", ""pandemic"", ""assess"", ""inequality"", ""society"", ""protect"", ""vulnerable"", ""people"", ""objective"", ""paper"", ""geographically"", ""understand"", ""discrimination"", ""inequality"", ""minority"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""design"", ""locational"", ""discrimination"", ""index"", ""ldi"", ""measure"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""discrimination"", ""minority"", ""county"", ""level"", ""we"", ""ldi"", ""difference"", ""death"", ""proportion"", ""minority"", ""proportion"", ""minority"", ""population"", ""ldi"", ""0"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""discrimination"", ""identify"", ""minority"", ""county"", ""develop"", ""locational"", ""minority"", ""inequality"", ""index"", ""lmii"", ""lmii"", ""minority"", ""directly"", ""quantify"", ""compare"", ""ldi"", ""ldi"", ""majority"", ""population"", ""e"", ""white"", ""population"", ""we"", ""lmii"", ""0"", ""health"", ""inequality"", ""confirm"", ""minority"", ""county"", ""we"", ""find"", ""157"", ""county"", ""discrimination"", ""black"", ""people"", ""103"", ""county"", ""inequality"", ""black"", ""people"", ""58"", ""county"", ""discrimination"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""population"", ""38"", ""county"", ""inequality"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""population"", ""17"", ""county"", ""discrimination"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""8"", ""county"", ""inequality"", ""hispanic"", ""people"", ""47"", ""county"", ""discrimination"", ""64"", ""county"", ""inequality"", ""asian"", ""7"", ""county"", ""discrimination"", ""28"", ""inequality"", ""ldi"", ""lmii"", ""thematic"", ""mapping"", ""provide"", ""novel"", ""insight"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""discrimination"", ""inequality"", ""good"", ""knowledge"", ""first"", ""time"", ""anyone"", ""quantitatively"", ""statistically"", ""define"", ""map"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""discrimination"", ""inequality"", ""minority"", ""county"", ""level"", ""across"", ""we"", ""base"", ""government"", ""community"", ""could"", ""make"", ""efficient"", ""decision"", ""take"", ""effective"", ""action"", ""addressthe"", ""discrimination"", ""inequality"", ""black"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""people"", ""apply"", ""pandemic"", ""public"", ""health"", ""disaster"", ""usa"", ""country""]",None,aging,None,"Black, Asian, Hispanic"

"Access and outcomes among minority transplant patients, 1999-2008, with a focus on determinants of kidney graft survival.","Coincident with an increasing national interest in equitable health care, a number of studies have described disparities in access to solid organ transplantation for minority patients. In contrast, relatively little is known about differences in posttransplant outcomes between patients of specific racial and ethnic populations. In this paper, we review trends in access to solid organ transplantation and posttransplant outcomes by organ type, race and ethnicity. In addition, we present an analysis of categories of factors that contribute to the racial/ethnic variation seen in kidney transplant outcomes. Disparities in minority access to transplantation among wait-listed candidates are improving, but persist for those awaiting kidney, simultaneous kidney and pancreas and intestine transplantation. In general, graft and patient survival among recipients of solid organ transplants is highest for Asians and Hispanic/Latinos, intermediate for whites and lowest for African Americans. Although much of the difference in outcomes between racial/ethnic groups can be accounted for by adjusting for patient characteristics, important observed differences remain.

"Melanoma arising in African-, Asian-, Latino- and Native-American populations.","This review highlights melanoma trends observed among African-, Asian-, Latino- and Native-American populations. Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, accounting for about 75% of all skin cancer deaths. Generally, incidence rates increase with age, peak after age 40, and are greater in men than women. However, these trends do not reflect what is typically seen in minority ethnic groups, where incidence rates are lower. In addition, for some groups, relative disease-specific survival also is lower compared with European-Americans. Melanomas in minority populations also tend to appear in atypical locations and are of unclear etiology. To improve our understanding of the causes of melanoma arising in ethnic minority populations future research efforts are needed.

Links between patterns of racial socialization and discrimination experiences and psychological adjustment: a cluster analysis.,"This study used a person-oriented analytic approach to identify meaningful patterns of barriers-focused racial socialization and perceived racial discrimination experiences in a sample of 295 late adolescents. Using cluster analysis, three distinct groups were identified: Low Barrier Socialization-Low Discrimination, High Barrier Socialization-Low Discrimination, and High Barrier Socialization-High Discrimination clusters. These groups were substantively unique in terms of the frequency of racial socialization messages about bias preparation and out-group mistrust its members received and their actual perceived discrimination experiences. Further, individuals in the High Barrier Socialization-High Discrimination cluster reported significantly higher depressive symptoms than those in the Low Barrier Socialization-Low Discrimination and High Barrier Socialization-Low Discrimination clusters.

Ethnic identity and personal well-being of people of color: a meta-analysis.,"This article summarizes research examining the relationship between the constructs of ethnic identity and personal well-being among people of color in North America. Data from 184 studies analyzed with random effects models yielded an omnibus effect size of r = .17, suggesting a modest relationship between the 2 constructs. The relationship was somewhat stronger among adolescents and young adults than among adults over age 40. No differences were observed across participant race, gender, or socioeconomic status, which findings support the general relevance of ethnic identity across people of color. Studies correlating ethnic identity with self-esteem and positive well-being yielded average effect sizes twice as large as those from studies correlating ethnic identity with personal distress or mental health symptoms. Ethnic identity was thus more strongly related to positive well-being than to compromised well-being.

How Do Racial/Ethnic Groups Differ in Their Use of Neighborhood Parks? Findings from the National Study of Neighborhood Parks.,"The current study examined racial/ethnic differences in use of parks and park facilities and features and self-reported park use and perceptions. We conducted observations in a nationally representative sample of 193 neighborhood parks in 27 US cities over a 1-week period between April and August of 2016 using the System of Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC). To determine the propensity of different racial/ethnic groups to use parks relative to expectation based on their representation in the surrounding neighborhood, we calculated the percentages of park users of each race/ethnicity and compared these to the percentages of racial/ethnic groups residing in the neighborhood within a 1-mile radius of the park based on 2010 U.S. Census data. In the same parks, we administered an intercept survey to assess park users' self-reported use and perceptions of the park (N = 1872). We examined racial/ethnic differences in self-reported use and perceptions of parks using GEE models that adjusted for several individual- and park-level covariates. Hispanics comprised a disproportionate percentage of observed park users. Racial/ethnic groups generally did not differ in their self-reported park use and perceptions, except for the social context of park visits. In adjusted models, Hispanics had significantly higher odds of visiting with a child family member (OR = 1.44) and lower odds of visiting alone than non-Hispanic whites (OR = .55).

Relationship education in community settings: effectiveness with distressed and non-distressed low-income racial minority couples.,"Couple relationship education (CRE) programs are intended to prevent negative couple outcomes, however, some evidence suggests couples in greater distress may still benefit. The current study examined pre- and postchanges in relationship functioning of 362 low-income African American and Hispanic couples. Outcomes (dedication and communication) were assessed by examining differences between two distinct groupings of couples; distressed (both partners reporting clinically significant distress) and nondistressed (neither partner reporting clinically significant distress) couples.

Awareness of racial and ethnic health disparities has improved only modestly over a decade.,"Documented disparities exist in the United States between the majority white population and various racial and ethnic minority populations on several health and health care indicators, including access to and quality of care, disease prevalence, infant mortality, and life expectancy. However, awareness of these disparities-a necessary first step toward changing behavior and compelling action-remains limited. Our survey of 3,159 adults age eighteen or older found that 59 percent of Americans in 2010 were aware of racial and ethnic disparities that disproportionately affect African Americans and Hispanics or Latinos. That number represents a modest increase over the 55 percent recorded in a 1999 survey. Meanwhile, in our survey, 89 percent of African American respondents were aware of African American and white disparities, versus 55 percent of whites. Yet the survey also revealed low levels of awareness among racial and ethnic minority groups about disparities that disproportionately affect their own communities. For example, only 54 percent of African Americans were aware of disparities in the rate of HIV/AIDS between African Americans and whites, and only 21 percent of Hispanics or Latinos were aware of those disparities between their group and whites.

Ethnic differences in bullying victimization and psychological distress: A test of an ecological model.,"This study examines ethnic differences in the prevalence of bullying victimization by peers as well as the associations between bullying victimization and psychological distress with relevant ecological factors including parental supervision, school support, and community safety. The study utilized the 2011-2012 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) Adolescents Data, which was collected in the United States using a multi-stage stratified sampling design with a Random Digit-Dial method. The final study sample contained a total of 2367 adolescents, comprised of 48.7% Whites, followed by 35.8% Latinos, 11.1% Asians, and 4.4% African Americans. About 49.3% were males with an overall mean age of 14.6 (sd = 1.7). Results showed that there were significant differences in rates of bullying victimization among the four surveyed ethnic subgroups of adolescents. Black adolescents reported the highest and Asian adolescents the lowest level of victimization. The results of the SEM test using the calibration sample revealed an adequate fit to the data (CFI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.04, Δχ<sup>2</sup>/Δdf = 2.99). Separate model tests with the four subgroups of adolescents revealed good fits with the subsample data with the exception of the subsample of African Americans.

The Influence of Sociodemographic and Psychosocial Factors on Advance Care Planning.,"This study investigated sociodemographic and psychosocial factors that enhance or impede the completion of advance care planning, analyzing data from the Health and Retirement Study. The analytic subsample included the panel participants who died between 2006 and 2010 and who had answered the psychosocial and lifestyle questionnaire when they were alive. Multinomial logistic regression was executed to answer the research question (N = 1,056). The study found that persons who were older, who were women, who identified themselves as White, and who had higher levels of income and education were more likely to be motivated to complete advance care planning. Having greater sense of control was found to weaken the adverse relationship between being African American and the completion of advance directives. Having cancer, suffering from the illnesses for longer periods of time, and having experience of nursing home institutionalization also predicted the completion of advance care planning. Implications include incorporating a culturally tailored approach for racial/ethnic minorities and using advance directives that are clear and easily understood. In addition, future research needs to include a larger minority population and examine the extent to which variations between racial/ethnic groups exist in relation to advance care planning.",Journal of gerontological social work,"[""investigate"", ""sociodemographic"", ""psychosocial"", ""factor"", ""enhance"", ""impede"", ""completion"", ""advance"", ""care"", ""planning"", ""analyze"", ""datum"", ""health"", ""retirement"", ""analytic"", ""subsample"", ""include"", ""panel"", ""participant"", ""die"", ""2006"", ""2010"", ""answer"", ""psychosocial"", ""lifestyle"", ""questionnaire"", ""alive"", ""multinomial"", ""logistic"", ""regression"", ""execute"", ""answer"", ""research"", ""question"", ""n"", ""1"", ""056"", ""find"", ""person"", ""old"", ""woman"", ""identify"", ""white"", ""high"", ""level"", ""income"", ""education"", ""likely"", ""motivate"", ""complete"", ""advance"", ""care"", ""plan"", ""great"", ""sense"", ""find"", ""weaken"", ""adverse"", ""relationship"", ""african"", ""american"", ""completion"", ""advance"", ""directive"", ""cancer"", ""suffer"", ""illness"", ""long"", ""period"", ""time"", ""experience"", ""nursing"", ""home"", ""institutionalization"", ""also"", ""predict"", ""completion"", ""advance"", ""care"", ""planning"", ""implication"", ""include"", ""incorporate"", ""culturally"", ""tailor"", ""approach"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""use"", ""advance"", ""directive"", ""clear"", ""easily"", ""understand"", ""addition"", ""future"", ""research"", ""need"", ""include"", ""large"", ""minority"", ""population"", ""examine"", ""extent"", ""variation"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""exist"", ""relation"", ""advance"", ""care"", ""planning""]",None,None,None,None

Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Insurance Coverage in the USA: Findings from the 2018 National Health Interview Survey.,"Under the broad context of health care reforms, I explored racial and ethnic disparities in health insurance coverage as well as potential mechanisms that might contribute to these disparities for an extensive list of groups. The study used the 2018 National Health Interview Survey to analyze the effects of race/ethnicity on uninsurance, with adjustment for other predisposing characteristics (age, gender, marital status, and immigration status), enabling resources (education, income, language proficiency, and region), and need (self-reported health status). Results from the study documented an average uninsured rate of 13%, with substantial variations across different racial and ethnic groups, ranging from over 30% among Native Americans and Mexicans to less than 10% among whites and Asian subgroups. Enabling resources significantly reduced uninsurance among African Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans compared to whites. On the other hand, these confounding factors only partially contributed to uninsurance among Native Americans, Mexicans, Mexican Americans, Dominicans, and other Central and South Americans. This study revealed substantial racial/ethnic disparities in uninsured rates, with Native Americans and a few Hispanic subgroups (Mexicans, Mexican Americans, and Dominicans) having higher and Asian Indians having lower rates than whites in uninsurance.

And, to the extent possible, they used ESP to assess racial and ethnic disparities in the occurrence of selected notifiable infectious diseases. For the 30 reporting areas (29 States and the District of Columbia) that provided data to ESP for all of calendar year 1987, approximately 60 percent of case reports were accompanied by specified race-ethnicity for affected persons. This percentage varied widely by disease and State. In general, non-Hispanic whites had morbidity rates (cases per 100,000 population per year) that were among the lowest compared with rates for other groups, and Native Americans commonly had rates that were among the highest. The ranking of morbidity rates among blacks, Hispanics, and Asians and Pacific Islanders varied by disease, although the last group had strikingly higher rates for malaria and tuberculosis. The age distribution of persons with cases was often lower among minority groups than among non-Hispanic whites, but the authors were unable to calculate age-specific or age-adjusted rates. Potential biases that limit interpretation of the findings are reviewed. Efforts to eliminate racial-ethnic disparities in the occurrence of infectious diseases would be aided by effective surveillance data. For the ESP to meet its potential in this regard, however, substantial improvements in the reporting of race-ethnicity for notifiable diseases are needed.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)","[""author"", ""use"", ""1987"", ""datum"", ""epidemiologic"", ""surveillance"", ""project"", ""esp"", ""center"", ""disease"", ""examine"", ""completeness"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""report"", ""national"", ""notifiable"", ""disease"", ""surveillance"", ""system"", ""extent"", ""possible"", ""use"", ""esp"", ""assess"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""occurrence"", ""select"", ""notifiable"", ""infectious"", ""disease"", ""30"", ""reporting"", ""area"", ""29"", ""state"", ""district"", ""columbia"", ""provide"", ""datum"", ""esp"", ""calendar"", ""year"", ""1987"", ""approximately"", ""60"", ""percent"", ""case"", ""report"", ""accompany"", ""specified"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""affect"", ""person"", ""percentage"", ""vary"", ""widely"", ""disease"", ""state"", ""general"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""morbidity"", ""rate"", ""case"", ""per"", ""100"", ""000"", ""population"", ""per"", ""year"", ""among"", ""low"", ""compared"", ""rate"", ""group"", ""native"", ""american"", ""commonly"", ""rate"", ""among"", ""high"", ""ranking"", ""morbidity"", ""rate"", ""among"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""pacific"", ""islander"", ""vary"", ""disease"", ""although"", ""last"", ""group"", ""strikingly"", ""high"", ""rate"", ""malaria"", ""tuberculosis"", ""age"", ""distribution"", ""person"", ""case"", ""often"", ""low"", ""among"", ""minority"", ""group"", ""among"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""author"", ""unable"", ""calculate"", ""age"", ""specific"", ""age"", ""adjusted"", ""rate"", ""potential"", ""bias"", ""limit"", ""interpretation"", ""finding"", ""review"", ""effort"", ""eliminate"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""occurrence"", ""infectious"", ""disease"", ""would"", ""aid"", ""effective"", ""surveillance"", ""datum"", ""esp"", ""meet"", ""potential"", ""regard"", ""however"", ""substantial"", ""improvement"", ""report"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""notifiable"", ""disease"", ""need""]",None,None,None,"Asian, Native American, Hispanic"

Community health centers tackle rising demands and expectations.,"As key providers of preventive and primary care for underserved people, including the uninsured, community health centers (CHCs) are the backbone of the U.S. health care safety net. Despite significant federal funding increases, community health centers are struggling to meet rising demand for care, particularly for specialty medical, dental and mental health services, according to findings from the Center for Studying Health System Change's (HSC) 2007 site visits to 12 nationally representative metropolitan communities. Health centers are responding to these pressures by expanding capacity and adding services but confront staffing, resource and other constraints.

Emotional Implications of Weight Stigma Across Middle School: The Role of Weight-Based Peer Discrimination.,"This study considered the emotional consequences of weight stigmatization in early adolescence by examining the effects of weight-based peer discrimination across middle school. Sampled across 26 urban middle schools, 5,128 youth (52% girls) with complete body mass index data at sixth or 7th grade were included: 30% Latino, 21% White, 14% East/Southeast Asian, 14% Multiethnic, 12% African American/Black, and 9% from other specific ethnic groups. About one third of the sample reported at least one weight-discrimination incident at 7th grade. Controlling for sixth-grade adjustment, perceptions of weight-based peer discrimination at 7th grade were stronger predictors of body dissatisfaction, social anxiety, and loneliness (and somatic symptoms for girls but not boys) at 8th-grade than 7th-grade body mass index. Moreover, heavier body stature during the 1st year in middle school was associated with increased body dissatisfaction by the end of middle school in part due to weight-related disrespectful, exclusionary, and demeaning treatment by peers. Weight-based peer discrimination helps us understand one of the stigmatizing mechanisms underlying the relation between heavy body stature and the progression of emotional problems in early adolescence.","Journal of clinical child and adolescent psychology : the official journal for the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, American Psychological Association, Division 53","[""consider"", ""emotional"", ""consequence"", ""weight"", ""stigmatization"", ""early"", ""adolescence"", ""examine"", ""effect"", ""weight"", ""based"", ""peer"", ""discrimination"", ""across"", ""middle"", ""school"", ""sample"", ""across"", ""26"", ""urban"", ""middle"", ""school"", ""5"", ""128"", ""youth"", ""52"", ""girl"", ""complete"", ""body"", ""mass"", ""index"", ""datum"", ""sixth"", ""7th"", ""grade"", ""include"", ""30"", ""latino"", ""21"", ""white"", ""14"", ""east"", ""southeast"", ""asian"", ""14"", ""multiethnic"", ""12"", ""african"", ""american"", ""black"", ""9"", ""specific"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""one"", ""third"", ""sample"", ""report"", ""least"", ""one"", ""weight"", ""discrimination"", ""incident"", ""7th"", ""grade"", ""control"", ""sixth"", ""grade"", ""adjustment"", ""perception"", ""weight"", ""based"", ""peer"", ""discrimination"", ""7th"", ""grade"", ""strong"", ""predictor"", ""body"", ""dissatisfaction"", ""social"", ""anxiety"", ""loneliness"", ""somatic"", ""symptom"", ""girl"", ""boy"", ""8th"", ""grade"", ""7th"", ""grade"", ""body"", ""mass"", ""index"", ""moreover"", ""heavy"", ""body"", ""stature"", ""1st"", ""year"", ""middle"", ""school"", ""associate"", ""increase"", ""body"", ""dissatisfaction"", ""end"", ""middle"", ""school"", ""part"", ""due"", ""weight"", ""related"", ""disrespectful"", ""exclusionary"", ""demeaning"", ""treatment"", ""peer"", ""weight"", ""based"", ""peer"", ""discrimination"", ""help"", ""we"", ""understand"", ""one"", ""stigmatizing"", ""mechanism"", ""underlie"", ""relation"", ""heavy"", ""body"", ""stature"", ""progression"", ""emotional"", ""problem"", ""early"", ""adolescence""]",anxiety,None,None,"Black, Latino, Asian"

Positive Youth Development Among Diverse Racial-Ethnic Children: Quality Afterschool Contexts as Developmental Assets.,"Positive youth development (PYD) deserves more empirical attention, particularly among children of diverse racial-ethnic backgrounds. Given the need among families for monitoring and supervision during out-of-school time, community-based afterschool is a potentially promotive ecological setting.

Racial/Ethnic Differences in Use of Health Care Services for Diabetes Management.,"Research demonstrates consistent racial/ethnic disparities in access to and use of health care services for a variety of chronic conditions. Yet we know little about whether these disparities exist for use of health care services for diabetes management. Racial/ethnic minorities disproportionately suffer from diabetes, complications from diabetes, and diabetes-related mortality. Proper diabetes management can reduce the risk of complications and premature mortality. Using a large national data set (N = 37,705) of White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American U.S. adults aged 65 years and older who have been diagnosed with diabetes, we examine three specific types of health care provider (HCP) use for diabetes management: number of times seen by a health care professional for diabetes, number of times feet have been checked by a health care professional, and number of visits for a glycosylated hemoglobin check. We found that net of controls for a variety of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, Blacks and Hispanics had significantly more visits to a HCP for their diabetes and significantly more glycosylated hemoglobin checks than Whites, and Blacks and Native Americans had significantly more HCP feet checks than Whites. Our results suggest that the reduced access to health care services traditionally found among racial/ethnic minorities does not hold for access to health care services for diabetes management, where racial/ethnic minority diabetics are actually more likely to use care than are White diabetics. Future research should examine whether higher use of health care services for diabetes among racial/ethnic minorities is due to greater disease severity among racial/ethnic minorities than among non-Hispanic Whites.",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,"[""research"", ""demonstrate"", ""consistent"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""access"", ""use"", ""health"", ""care"", ""service"", ""variety"", ""chronic"", ""condition"", ""yet"", ""know"", ""little"", ""whether"", ""disparity"", ""exist"", ""use"", ""health"", ""care"", ""service"", ""diabete"", ""management"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""disproportionately"", ""suffer"", ""diabetes"", ""complication"", ""diabete"", ""diabete"", ""related"", ""mortality"", ""proper"", ""diabetes"", ""management"", ""reduce"", ""risk"", ""complication"", ""premature"", ""mortality"", ""use"", ""large"", ""national"", ""datum"", ""set"", ""n"", ""37"", ""705"", ""white"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""native"", ""american"", ""u"", ""adult"", ""aged"", ""65"", ""year"", ""old"", ""diagnose"", ""diabete"", ""examine"", ""three"", ""specific"", ""type"", ""health"", ""care"", ""provider"", ""hcp"", ""use"", ""diabetes"", ""management"", ""number"", ""time"", ""see"", ""health"", ""care"", ""professional"", ""diabete"", ""number"", ""time"", ""foot"", ""check"", ""health"", ""care"", ""professional"", ""number"", ""visit"", ""glycosylated"", ""hemoglobin"", ""check"", ""find"", ""net"", ""control"", ""variety"", ""demographic"", ""socioeconomic"", ""characteristic"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""significantly"", ""visit"", ""hcp"", ""diabete"", ""significantly"", ""glycosylate"", ""hemoglobin"", ""check"", ""white"", ""black"", ""native"", ""american"", ""significantly"", ""hcp"", ""foot"", ""check"", ""white"", ""suggest"", ""reduce"", ""access"", ""health"", ""care"", ""service"", ""traditionally"", ""find"", ""among"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""hold"", ""access"", ""health"", ""care"", ""service"", ""diabete"", ""management"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""diabetic"", ""actually"", ""likely"", ""use"", ""care"", ""white"", ""diabetic"", ""future"", ""research"", ""examine"", ""whether"", ""high"", ""use"", ""health"", ""care"", ""service"", ""diabete"", ""among"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""due"", ""great"", ""disease"", ""severity"", ""among"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""among"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white""]",None,None,None,"Black, Asian, Native American, Hispanic"
"U.S. Dental School Applicants and Enrollees, 2014 Entering Class.","This report analyzes data collected annually by the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) on the characteristics of applicants to and first-year enrollees in dental schools. Among the key findings this year are that, since 2010, there has been a gradual decline in the number of individuals taking the Dental Admission Test (DAT), while the number applying to dental schools has remained relatively flat. During the same five-year time period, the number of first-year dental students has continuously increased. The result is an increasing rate of enrollment among applicants. While the overwhelming majority of dental schools utilize some aspect of a holistic admissions process, the DAT scores and grade point averages of applicants and enrollees continue to rise. Unlike a decade ago, women now account for nearly half of all applicants and enrollees. At least part of the gain has come from a decline in the number of men applicants, rather than a change in the enrollment rate.

Housing tenure and residential segregation in metropolitan America.,"Homeownership, a symbol of the American dream, is one of the primary ways through which families accumulate wealth, particularly for blacks and Hispanics. Surprisingly, no study has explicitly documented the segregation of minority owners and renters from whites. Using data from Census 2000, this study aims to fill this gap. Analyses here reveal that the segregation of black renters relative to whites is significantly lower than the segregation of black owners from whites, controlling for relevant socioeconomic and demographic factors, contrary to the notion that homeownership represents an endpoint in the residential assimilation process. The patterns for Hispanics and Asians conform more to expectations under the spatial assimilation model.

Racial disparities in outcomes after spinal cord injury.,"Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is an acute trauma to the neural elements resulting in temporary or permanent sensory and motor deficit. Studies have indicated that although 66% of SCI occur in Caucasians, there are a growing number of other racial groups affected by SCI. Furthermore, there has been a lack of research concerning racial disparities in outcomes following SCI. As such, a retrospective analysis using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) from 2000 to 2009 was performed. African Americans, Caucasians, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans were included in the study. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (OR) to examine the relationship between racial backgrounds and mortality, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of hospital stay, in-hospital complications, and patient disposition. Our results showed that significant differences were found in length of hospital stay, with African American and Hispanic populations having longer hospital stays than Caucasian and Asians. For all type complications, African Americans (OR 1.228, confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.356) and Native Americans (OR 1.618, CI 1.083-2.419) were more likely than Caucasian and Hispanic patients to have in-hospital complications.

Ethnic/Racial Comparisons in Strategies Parents Use to Cope with Food Insecurity: A Systematic Review of Published Research.,"Food insecurity in US affects African Americans, Hispanic, and American Indians disproportionately compared to Caucasians. Ethnicity/race may influence the strategies parents use to reduce the effects of food insecurity. The purpose of this review is to compare coping strategies for food insecurity used by parents of different ethnicities/race as reported in published literature. A systematic search on PubMed and Embase yielded 983 studies, of which 13 studies met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. All groups used public and private assistance, social networks, nutrition related, and financial-related strategies. The limited evidence suggests that there are differences in how parents of different ethnicities/race apply these coping strategies. Current evidence is insufficient to confidently determine the extent of these differences.

The determinants of neighborhood satisfaction: racial proxy revisited.,"Understanding the factors that drive individuals' residential preferences is a critical issue in the study of racial segregation. An important debate within this field is whether individuals-especially whites-prefer to live in predominantly white neighborhoods because they wish to avoid the social problems that may be more likely to occur in predominantly black neighborhoods (i.e., the racial proxy hypothesis) or because of racial factors that go beyond these social class-related characteristics. Through a multilevel analysis of data from the 2004-2005 Chicago Area Study and several administrative sources, we assess the extent to which the racial proxy hypothesis describes neighborhood satisfaction among whites, African Americans, and Latinos living across a broad range of neighborhood contexts. The racial proxy perspective applies weakly to whites' satisfaction: whites report less satisfaction in neighborhoods with more minority residents, and only some of their dissatisfaction can be attributed to local social characteristics. The racial proxy hypothesis applies more strongly to blacks' and Latinos' satisfaction. In some cases, especially for Latinos, higher levels of satisfaction in integrated neighborhoods can largely be attributed to the fact that these places have better socioeconomic conditions and fewer social problems than predominantly minority communities. At the same time, effects of racial/ethnic composition persist in unique and somewhat divergent ways for blacks and Latinos, supporting the assertion that racial composition matters, above and beyond its relation to social class. Taken together, these findings suggest that individuals balance both socioeconomic and race-related concerns in their residential preferences.",Demography,"[""understand"", ""factor"", ""drive"", ""individual"", ""residential"", ""preference"", ""critical"", ""issue"", ""racial"", ""segregation"", ""important"", ""debate"", ""within"", ""field"", ""whether"", ""individual"", ""especially"", ""white"", ""prefer"", ""live"", ""predominantly"", ""white"", ""neighborhood"", ""wish"", ""avoid"", ""social"", ""problem"", ""may"", ""likely"", ""occur"", ""predominantly"", ""black"", ""neighborhood"", ""e"", ""racial"", ""proxy"", ""hypothesis"", ""racial"", ""factor"", ""go"", ""beyond"", ""social"", ""class"", ""related"", ""characteristic"", ""multilevel"", ""analysis"", ""datum"", ""2004"", ""2005"", ""chicago"", ""area"", ""several"", ""administrative"", ""source"", ""assess"", ""extent"", ""racial"", ""proxy"", ""hypothesis"", ""describe"", ""neighborhood"", ""satisfaction"", ""among"", ""white"", ""african"", ""american"", ""latinos"", ""live"", ""across"", ""broad"", ""range"", ""neighborhood"", ""context"", ""racial"", ""proxy"", ""perspective"", ""apply"", ""weakly"", ""white"", ""satisfaction"", ""white"", ""report"", ""less"", ""satisfaction"", ""neighborhood"", ""minority"", ""resident"", ""dissatisfaction"", ""attribute"", ""local"", ""social"", ""characteristic"", ""racial"", ""proxy"", ""hypothesis"", ""apply"", ""strongly"", ""black"", ""latinos"", ""satisfaction"", ""case"", ""especially"", ""latinos"", ""high"", ""level"", ""satisfaction"", ""integrated"", ""neighborhood"", ""largely"", ""attribute"", ""fact"", ""place"", ""well"", ""socioeconomic"", ""condition"", ""few"", ""social"", ""problem"", ""predominantly"", ""minority"", ""community"", ""time"", ""effect"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""composition"", ""persist"", ""unique"", ""somewhat"", ""divergent"", ""way"", ""black"", ""latinos"", ""support"", ""assertion"", ""racial"", ""composition"", ""matter"", ""beyond"", ""relation"", ""social"", ""class"", ""take"", ""together"", ""finding"", ""suggest"", ""individual"", ""balance"", ""socioeconomic"", ""race"", ""related"", ""concern"", ""residential"", ""preference""]",None,None,social class,Latino

Race and Ethnicity Influences Outcomes of Adult Burn Patients.,"Outcomes of burn survivors is a growing field of interest; however, there is little data comparing the outcomes of burn survivors by ethnicity. This study seeks to identify any inequities in burn outcomes by racial and ethnic groups. A retrospective chart review of an ABA Certified burn center at a large urban safety net hospital identified adult inpatient admissions from 2015 to 2019. A total of 1142 patients were categorized by primary ethnicity: 142 black or African American, 72 Asian, 479 Hispanic or Latino, 90 white, 215 other, and 144 patients whose race or ethnicity was unrecorded. Multivariable analyses evaluated the relationship between race and ethnicity and outcomes. Covariate confounders were controlled by adjustment of demographic, social, and prehospital clinical factors to isolate differences that might not be explained by other factors. After controlling for covariates, black patients had 29% longer hospital stays (P = .043). Hispanic patients were more likely to be discharged to home or to hospice care (P = .005). Hispanic ethnicity was associated with a 44% decrease in the odds of discharge to acute care, inpatient rehabilitation, or a ward outside the burn unit (P = .022). Black and Hispanic patients had a higher relative chance of having publicly assisted insurance, versus private insurance, than their white counterparts (P = .041, P = .011 respectively). The causes of these inequities are indeterminate. They may stem from socioeconomic status not entirely accounted for, ethnic differences in comorbidity related to stressors, or inequity in health care delivery.",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,"[""outcome"", ""burn"", ""survivor"", ""grow"", ""field"", ""interest"", ""however"", ""little"", ""datum"", ""compare"", ""outcome"", ""burn"", ""survivor"", ""ethnicity"", ""seek"", ""identify"", ""inequity"", ""burn"", ""outcome"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""retrospective"", ""chart"", ""review"", ""aba"", ""certify"", ""burn"", ""center"", ""large"", ""urban"", ""safety"", ""net"", ""hospital"", ""identify"", ""adult"", ""inpatient"", ""admission"", ""2015"", ""2019"", ""total"", ""1142"", ""patient"", ""categorize"", ""primary"", ""ethnicity"", ""142"", ""black"", ""african"", ""american"", ""72"", ""asian"", ""479"", ""hispanic"", ""latino"", ""90"", ""white"", ""215"", ""144"", ""patient"", ""whose"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""unrecorded"", ""multivariable"", ""analysis"", ""evaluate"", ""relationship"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""outcome"", ""covariate"", ""confounder"", ""control"", ""adjustment"", ""demographic"", ""social"", ""prehospital"", ""clinical"", ""factor"", ""isolate"", ""difference"", ""might"", ""explained"", ""factor"", ""control"", ""covariate"", ""black"", ""patient"", ""29"", ""long"", ""hospital"", ""stay"", ""p"", ""043"", ""hispanic"", ""patient"", ""likely"", ""discharge"", ""home"", ""hospice"", ""care"", ""p"", ""005"", ""hispanic"", ""ethnicity"", ""associate"", ""44"", ""decrease"", ""odd"", ""discharge"", ""acute"", ""care"", ""inpatient"", ""rehabilitation"", ""ward"", ""outside"", ""burn"", ""unit"", ""p"", ""022"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""patient"", ""high"", ""relative"", ""chance"", ""publicly"", ""assist"", ""insurance"", ""versus"", ""private"", ""insurance"", ""white"", ""counterpart"", ""p"", ""041"", ""p"", ""011"", ""respectively"", ""cause"", ""inequity"", ""indeterminate"", ""may"", ""stem"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""entirely"", ""account"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""comorbidity"", ""related"", ""stressor"", ""inequity"", ""health"", ""care"", ""delivery""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,"Black, Latino, Asian, Hispanic"
Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and obsessive-compulsive disorder: a multiracial/ethnic analysis of a student population.,"The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and the Padua Inventory Washington State University Revision are commonly used measures of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

The current study examined the measurement invariance of the Experiences Questionnaire (Fresco et al., 2007), a commonly used measure of decentering, evaluating age, gender, race/ethnicity, and meditation experience in three samples (students, community members, and clinical participants). Each sample was tested separately to assess the generalizability of results. The Experiences Questionnaire demonstrated full or partial measurement invariance in all cases, suggesting that scores are not biased based upon group membership and may be compared across individuals who vary in age, race/ethnicity, gender, and meditation experience. The current study also examined mean differences in decentering by groups, finding some evidence that decentering scores are higher for men, racial/ethnic minorities, older adults, and individuals with more meditation experiences. Implications are discussed for assessing decentering in diverse samples.

"Availability and Consumption of Fruits and Vegetables Among Non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in the USA: Findings from the 2011-2012 California Health Interview Adult Survey.","Racial and ethnic disparities in fruit and vegetable consumption have been widely studied in the USA. While previous studies focused on the differences of fruit and vegetable availability between racial groups, the equivalence of the association between consumption and availability across racial groups has been rarely examined. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between availability of fruits and vegetables and their consumption across racial groups. The 2011-2012 California Health Interview Survey data (N = 36,302) were used for the study. Results of negative binomial regression show that the association between perceived availability of fruits and vegetables on consumption differs significantly between non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians: (1) the association between fruit consumption and availability is only significant for non-Hispanic Whites (IRR = 1.303, 95 % CI 1.188, 1.429), and (2) the association between vegetable consumption and availability is only significant for non-Hispanic Whites (IRR = 1.242, 95 % CI 1.152, 1.340) and Hispanics (IRR = 1.141, 95 % CI 1.025, 1.271).

Racial microaggressions and difficult dialogues on race in the classroom.,"A qualitative study supports the observation that difficult dialogues on race and racism are often triggered by racial microaggressions that make their appearance in classroom encounters or educational activities and materials. Difficult dialogues are filled with strong powerful emotions that may prove problematic to both students and teachers. When poorly handled by teachers, difficult dialogues can assail the personal integrity of students of color while reinforcing biased worldviews of White students. The success or failure of facilitating difficult dialogues on race is intimately linked to the characteristics and actions of instructors and their ability to recognize racial microaggressions.

"Temporary integration, resilient inequality: race and neighborhood change in the transition to adulthood.","This article focuses on neighborhood and geographic change arising with the first ""selection"" of an independent residential setting: the transition out of the family home. Data from two sources-the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics-are used to provide complementary analyses of trajectories of change in geographic location and neighborhood racial and economic composition during young adulthood. Findings indicate that for young adults who originate in segregated urban areas and remain in such areas, the period of young adulthood is characterized by continuity in neighborhood conditions and persistent racial inequality from childhood to adulthood. For young adults who exit highly segregated urban areas, this period is characterized by a substantial leveling of racial inequality, with African Americans moving into less-poor, less-segregated neighborhoods. However, the trend toward racial equality in young adulthood is temporary, as the gaps between whites and blacks grow as the young adults move further into adulthood. Crucial to the reemergence of racial inequality in neighborhood environments is the process of ""unselected"" change, or change in neighborhood conditions that occurs around young adults after they move to a new neighborhood environment.",Demography,"[""article"", ""focus"", ""neighborhood"", ""geographic"", ""change"", ""arise"", ""first"", ""selection"", ""independent"", ""residential"", ""setting"", ""transition"", ""family"", ""home"", ""datum"", ""two"", ""source"", ""project"", ""human"", ""development"", ""chicago"", ""neighborhood"", ""panel"", ""income"", ""dynamic"", ""use"", ""provide"", ""complementary"", ""analysis"", ""trajectory"", ""change"", ""geographic"", ""location"", ""neighborhood"", ""racial"", ""economic"", ""composition"", ""young"", ""adulthood"", ""finding"", ""indicate"", ""young"", ""adult"", ""originate"", ""segregate"", ""urban"", ""area"", ""remain"", ""area"", ""period"", ""young"", ""adulthood"", ""characterize"", ""continuity"", ""neighborhood"", ""condition"", ""persistent"", ""racial"", ""inequality"", ""childhood"", ""adulthood"", ""young"", ""adult"", ""exit"", ""highly"", ""segregate"", ""urban"", ""area"", ""period"", ""characterize"", ""substantial"", ""level"", ""racial"", ""inequality"", ""african"", ""american"", ""move"", ""less"", ""poor"", ""less"", ""segregated"", ""neighborhood"", ""however"", ""trend"", ""toward"", ""racial"", ""equality"", ""young"", ""adulthood"", ""temporary"", ""gap"", ""white"", ""black"", ""grow"", ""young"", ""adult"", ""move"", ""adulthood"", ""crucial"", ""reemergence"", ""racial"", ""inequality"", ""neighborhood"", ""environment"", ""process"", ""unselected"", ""change"", ""change"", ""neighborhood"", ""condition"", ""occur"", ""around"", ""young"", ""adult"", ""move"", ""new"", ""neighborhood"", ""environment""]",None,None,None,None
Factor Structure for Chronic Stress Before and During Pregnancy by Racial/Ethnic Group.,"This study aimed to explore race/ethnicity-specific dimensionalities of chronic stress before and during pregnancy for non-Hispanic (N-H) White, N-H Black, Hispanic, and Asian women in the United States. This study analyzed the data among 6,850 women from the New York City and Washington State Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (2004-2007) linked with birth certificates. Separate exploratory factor analysis was conducted by race/ethnicity using a maximum-likelihood extraction method with 26 chronic stress items before and during pregnancy. Correlations and internal consistency reliabilities among items and latent factors determined race/ethnicity-specific factor structures of chronic stress. Chronic stress was race/ethnicity-distinctive and multidimensional with low correlations among the factors ( r = .07-.28, p < .05). Despite financial hardship, perceived isolation, and physical violence underlying chronic stress among the racial/ethnic groups, intergroup variations existed under each group's cultural or sociopolitical contexts.

Racial/Ethnic disparities in the chains of morbid events leading to death: network analysis of US multiple cause of death data.,"Multiple-cause-of-death data have not yet been applied to the study of racial/ethnic differences in causal chains of events leading to death, nor they have been used to examine racial/ethnic disparities in cause-of-death certification. We use publicly available 2019 US death certificate data to reassemble chains of morbid events leading to death. From them, we construct and analyze directed multiple cause of death networks by race and sex of deaths aged 60+. Three perspectives to measure disparities are employed: (i) relative prevalence of cause-of-death-pairs, (ii) strength of associations between diseases, (iii) similarities in transition matrices. Non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) had overall lower prevalence of cause of death pairs, Hispanics (HIS) were burdened more by alcohol-related mortality and Asian and Pacific Islanders (API) exceeded in transitions to cerebrovascular diseases. Lower similarity was observed in transitions to external causes of death, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, pulmonary heart diseases, interstitial respiratory diseases, and diseases of the liver. After excluding rare diseases, the similarity further decreased for ill-defined conditions, diabetes mellitus, other cardiovascular diseases, diseases of the pleura, and anemia.

The Long-Term Economic Benefits of Natural Mentoring Relationships for Youth.,"Natural mentors have been shown to help improve psychological and educational outcomes of youth, and may serve an important role for youth experiencing risk in the home. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), we investigated the associations between natural mentors during youth and income during early adulthood, including how these relations were moderated by the absence of a father figure and race. We also estimated the lifetime economic benefits to having a natural mentor. The presence of a natural mentor alone did not have a significant impact on annual earnings during adulthood. However, youth without a father but who had a male mentor earned significantly more, on average, than those without a male mentor. These effects were more pronounced in a subsample of African American youth. The net present value of total lifetime benefits to having a male natural mentor was approximately $190,000 for all fatherless youth and $458,000 for African American fatherless youth.

The association between body mass index and gestational diabetes mellitus varies by race/ethnicity.,"We examined body mass index (BMI) as a screening tool for gestational diabetes (GDM) and its sensitivity among different racial/ethnic groups. In a retrospective cohort study of 24,324 pregnant women at University of California, San Francisco, BMI was explored as a screening tool for GDM and was stratified by race/ethnicity. Sensitivity and specificity were examined using chi-square test and receiver-operator characteristic curves. BMI of ≥25.0 kg/m (2) as a screening threshold identified GDM in >76% of African-Americans, 58% of Latinas, and 46% of Caucasians, but only 25% of Asians ( P < 0.001).

The impact of ethnicity on response to antihypertensive therapy.,"The aim of this review is to assess the prevalence of complications and responses to various antihypertensive drug therapies in ethnic minority groups in the United States. In some instances, these comments are extended to responses of citizens in their countries of origin. The incidence of hypertension, mortality from hypertensive heart disease, stroke, and hypertensive renal disease are higher in African Americans. Although some Hispanic Americans have a lesser risk for hypertension, they have a greater risk for other risk factors such as diabetes and dyslipidemia. There is a similar association between income and mortality for both African Americans and Hispanic Americans. When compared to European Americans and other ethnic minorities, African Americans respond less favorably to beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Nevertheless, the observed response in African Americans to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers is clinically significant. The available literature indicates that Asian American responses to calcium antagonists seem to be more favorable than responses to ACE inhibitors and equivalent to their responses to diuretic and beta blocker therapy. Although there are few published studies of drug efficacy in Hispanic Americans, there appears to be no hierarchy in response to the various antihypertensive drug classes. Ethnicity is not an accurate criterion for predicting poor response to any class of antihypertensive therapy. Thus, there is little justification to use racial profiling as a criterion for the avoidance of selected drug classes because of presumed lack of efficacy. Observed differences in the incidence of hypertension and its poor outcomes have led some investigators to postulate that the etiology of hypertension in ethnic minority groups is intrinsically different from whites. Awareness of racial differences in hypertension outcomes evolved in the United States within a historical context that does not fully appreciate that race is often a surrogate for many social and economic factors that influence health status and healthcare delivery. Poor outcomes in ethnic minority groups occur in many diseases, not only hypertension. The goal of ethnicity-related research should be to describe the diversity of disease expression in humans and to target at-risk groups for prevention and early intervention.

Psychometric properties of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire for DSM-IV among four racial groups.,"The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-IV (GAD-Q-IV) is a self-report diagnostic measure of generalized anxiety disorder. Previous studies have established the psychometric properties of the GAD-Q-IV, revealing excellent diagnostic specificity and sensitivity as well as good test-retest reliability and convergent and discriminant validity (Newman et al., 2002). Recent analyses with other measures of anxiety symptoms have revealed differences across racial or national groups.

Reductions in condom use associated with such beliefs were however only apparent in African American men. Conspiracy beliefs were an independent predictor of reported condom use along with race/ethnicity, gender, education, and age group.

Based on the 1990 5% Public Use Microdata Survey, we develop life table models of healthy (or active) life for the major racial groups, by sex, in the United States. The analysis underscores the complexity of the relationship between morbidity and mortality in the population. For Asians, longer life is associated with fewer years lived in poor health. In contrast, Native Americans' relatively longer lives are accompanied by extended periods of chronic health problems. Of all racial groups, blacks live the fewest years, and they live a high proportion of those years with a chronic health problems. Hispanics also live substantially fewer years, yet the period of life they spend with a health problem is relatively compressed.

The role of provider supply and organization in reducing racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care in the U.S.,"Racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care access in the United States are well documented. Prior studies highlight the importance of individual and community factors such as health insurance coverage, language and cultural barriers, and socioeconomic differences, though these factors fail to explain the extent of measured disparities. A critical factor in mental health care access is a local area's organization and supply of mental health care providers. However, it is unclear how geographic differences in provider organization and supply impact racial/ethnic disparities. The present study is the first analysis of a nationally representative U.S. sample to identify contextual factors (county-level provider organization and supply, as well as socioeconomic characteristics) associated with use of mental health care services and how these factors differ across racial/ethnic groups. Hierarchical logistic models were used to examine racial/ethnic differences in the association of county-level provider organization (health maintenance organization (HMO) penetration) and supply (density of specialty mental health providers and existence of a community mental health center) with any use of mental health services and specialty mental health services. Models controlled for individual- and county-level socio-demographic and mental health characteristics. Increased county-level supply of mental health care providers was significantly associated with greater use of any mental health services and any specialty care, and these positive associations were greater for Latinos and African-Americans compared to non-Latino Whites. Expanding the mental health care workforce holds promise for reducing racial/ethnic disparities in mental health care access. Policymakers should consider that increasing the management of mental health care may not only decrease expenditures, but also provide a potential lever for reducing mental health care disparities between social groups.",Social science & medicine (1982),"[""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""care"", ""access"", ""united"", ""state"", ""well"", ""document"", ""prior"", ""study"", ""highlight"", ""importance"", ""individual"", ""community"", ""factor"", ""health"", ""insurance"", ""coverage"", ""language"", ""cultural"", ""barrier"", ""socioeconomic"", ""difference"", ""though"", ""factor"", ""fail"", ""explain"", ""extent"", ""measure"", ""disparity"", ""critical"", ""factor"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""care"", ""access"", ""local"", ""area"", ""organization"", ""supply"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""care"", ""provider"", ""however"", ""unclear"", ""geographic"", ""difference"", ""provider"", ""organization"", ""supply"", ""impact"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""present"", ""first"", ""analysis"", ""nationally"", ""representative"", ""u"", ""sample"", ""identify"", ""contextual"", ""factor"", ""county"", ""level"", ""provider"", ""organization"", ""supply"", ""well"", ""socioeconomic"", ""characteristic"", ""associate"", ""use"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""care"", ""service"", ""factor"", ""differ"", ""across"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""hierarchical"", ""logistic"", ""model"", ""use"", ""examine"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""association"", ""county"", ""level"", ""provider"", ""organization"", ""health"", ""maintenance"", ""organization"", ""hmo"", ""penetration"", ""supply"", ""density"", ""specialty"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""provider"", ""existence"", ""community"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""center"", ""use"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""service"", ""specialty"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""service"", ""model"", ""control"", ""individual"", ""county"", ""level"", ""socio"", ""demographic"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""characteristic"", ""increase"", ""county"", ""level"", ""supply"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""care"", ""provider"", ""significantly"", ""associate"", ""great"", ""use"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""service"", ""specialty"", ""care"", ""positive"", ""association"", ""great"", ""latinos"", ""african"", ""american"", ""compare"", ""non"", ""latino"", ""white"", ""expand"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""care"", ""workforce"", ""hold"", ""promise"", ""reduce"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""care"", ""access"", ""policymaker"", ""consider"", ""increase"", ""management"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""care"", ""may"", ""decrease"", ""expenditure"", ""also"", ""provide"", ""potential"", ""lever"", ""reduce"", ""mental"", ""health"", ""care"", ""disparity"", ""social"", ""group""]",None,None,None,Latino

Health-risk behaviors in early adolescence.,"The major morbidities and mortalities of adolescents are related to preventable risky behaviors, but how, when, and in whom these behaviors develop in early adolescence is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine which set of risk factors and protective resources of school-age children were best predictors of health-risk behaviors in early adolescence. A longitudinal, cohort sequential design was used with a diverse sample of 1,934 children in grades 4 through 8. Parents provided demographic and neighborhood data for children through a mailed survey. Children completed valid scales annually at schools, using audio-computer-assisted self-interviewing (A-CASI) technology. Significant gender and racial/ethnic differences were found in carrying a weapon and using alcohol. Higher perceived levels of stress increased the risk for alcohol use as did riding in a car with a driver who was drinking. Health behaviors exhibited while in 4th through 6th grades protected early adolescents from alcohol use and riding in a car with a driver who was drinking.

Projections of U.S. Edentulism prevalence following 5 decades of decline.,"After decades of decline in prevalence of complete tooth loss (edentulism), the trend continues to be misinterpreted, producing flawed projections and misdirected health goals. We investigated population trends in edentulism among U.S. adults aged ≥ 15 yr by creating time-series data from 5 national cross-sectional health surveys: 1957-1958 (n ≈ 100,000 adults), 1971-1975 (n = 14,655 adults), 1988-1998 (n = 18,011 adults), 1999-2002 (n = 12,336 adults), and 2009-2012 (n = 10,522 adults). Birth cohort analysis was used to isolate age and cohort effects. Geographic and sociodemographic variation in prevalence was investigated with a sixth U.S. survey of 432,519 adults conducted in 2010. Prevalence through 2050 was projected with age-cohort regression models using Monte-Carlo simulation of prediction intervals. Across the 5-decade observation period, edentulism prevalence declined from 18.9% in 1957-1958 (95% confidence limits: 18.4%, 19.4%) to 4.9% in 2009-2012 (95% confidence limits: 4.0%, 5.8%). The most influential determinant of the decline was the passing of generations born before the 1940s, whose rate of edentulism incidence (5%-6% per decade of age) far exceeded later cohorts (1%-3% per decade of age). High-income households experienced a greater relative decline, although a smaller absolute decline, than low-income households. By 2010, edentulism was a rare condition in high-income households, and it had contracted geographically to states with disproportionately high poverty. With the passing of generations born in the mid-20th century, the rate of decline in edentulism is projected to slow, reaching 2.6% (95% prediction limits: 2.1%, 3.1%) by 2050. The continuing decline will be offset only partially by population growth and population aging such that the predicted number of edentulous people in 2050 (8.6 million; 95% prediction limits: 6.8 million, 10.3 million) will be 30% lower than the 12.2 million edentulous people in 2010.",Journal of dental research,"[""decade"", ""decline"", ""prevalence"", ""complete"", ""tooth"", ""loss"", ""edentulism"", ""trend"", ""continue"", ""misinterpret"", ""produce"", ""flawed"", ""projection"", ""misdirect"", ""health"", ""goal"", ""investigate"", ""population"", ""trend"", ""edentulism"", ""among"", ""u"", ""adult"", ""aged"", ""15"", ""yr"", ""create"", ""time"", ""series"", ""datum"", ""5"", ""national"", ""cross"", ""sectional"", ""health"", ""survey"", ""1957"", ""1958"", ""n"", ""100"", ""000"", ""adult"", ""1971"", ""1975"", ""n"", ""14"", ""655"", ""adult"", ""1988"", ""1998"", ""n"", ""18"", ""011"", ""adult"", ""1999"", ""2002"", ""n"", ""12"", ""336"", ""adult"", ""2009"", ""2012"", ""n"", ""10"", ""522"", ""adult"", ""birth"", ""cohort"", ""analysis"", ""use"", ""isolate"", ""age"", ""cohort"", ""effect"", ""geographic"", ""sociodemographic"", ""variation"", ""prevalence"", ""investigate"", ""sixth"", ""u"", ""survey"", ""432"", ""519"", ""adult"", ""conduct"", ""2010"", ""prevalence"", ""2050"", ""project"", ""age"", ""cohort"", ""regression"", ""model"", ""use"", ""monte"", ""carlo"", ""simulation"", ""prediction"", ""interval"", ""across"", ""5"", ""decade"", ""observation"", ""period"", ""edentulism"", ""prevalence"", ""decline"", ""18"", ""9"", ""1957"", ""1958"", ""95"", ""confidence"", ""limit"", ""18"", ""4"", ""19"", ""4"", ""4"", ""9"", ""2009"", ""2012"", ""95"", ""confidence"", ""limit"", ""4"", ""0"", ""5"", ""8"", ""influential"", ""determinant"", ""decline"", ""passing"", ""generation"", ""bear"", ""1940s"", ""whose"", ""rate"", ""edentulism"", ""incidence"", ""5"", ""6"", ""per"", ""decade"", ""age"", ""far"", ""exceed"", ""late"", ""cohort"", ""1"", ""3"", ""per"", ""decade"", ""age"", ""high"", ""income"", ""household"", ""experience"", ""great"", ""relative"", ""decline"", ""although"", ""small"", ""absolute"", ""decline"", ""low"", ""income"", ""household"", ""2010"", ""edentulism"", ""rare"", ""condition"", ""high"", ""income"", ""household"", ""contract"", ""geographically"", ""state"", ""disproportionately"", ""high"", ""poverty"", ""passing"", ""generation"", ""bear"", ""mid"", ""20th"", ""century"", ""rate"", ""decline"", ""edentulism"", ""project"", ""slow"", ""reaching"", ""2"", ""6"", ""95"", ""prediction"", ""limit"", ""2"", ""1"", ""3"", ""1"", ""2050"", ""continue"", ""decline"", ""offset"", ""partially"", ""population"", ""growth"", ""population"", ""aging"", ""predict"", ""number"", ""edentulous"", ""people"", ""2050"", ""8"", ""6"", ""million"", ""95"", ""prediction"", ""limit"", ""6"", ""8"", ""million"", ""10"", ""3"", ""million"", ""30"", ""low"", ""12"", ""2"", ""million"", ""edentulous"", ""people"", ""2010""]",None,aging,poverty,None

Increased COVID-19 Infection Risk Drives Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Severe COVID-19 Outcomes.,"COVID-19 inequities have been well-documented. We evaluated whether higher rates of severe COVID-19 in racial and ethnic minority groups were driven by higher infection rates by evaluating if disparities remained when analyses were restricted to people with infection. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults insured through Kaiser Permanente (Colorado, Northwest, Washington), follow-up in March-September 2020. Laboratory results and hospitalization diagnosis codes identified individuals with COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 was defined as invasive mechanical ventilation or mortality. Self-reported race and ethnicity, demographics, and medical comorbidities were extracted from health records. Modified Poisson regression estimated adjusted relative risks (aRRs) of severe COVID-19 in full cohort and among individuals with infection. Our cohort included 1,052,774 individuals, representing diverse racial and ethnic minority groups (e.g., 68,887 Asian, 41,243 Black/African American, 93,580 Hispanic or Latino/a individuals). Among 7,399 infections, 442 individuals experienced severe COVID-19. In the full cohort, severe COVID-19 aRRs for Asian, Black/African American, and Hispanic individuals were 2.09 (95% CI: 1.36, 3.21), 2.02 (1.39, 2.93), and 2.09 (1.57, 2.78), respectively, compared to non-Hispanic Whites. In analyses restricted to individuals with COVID-19, all aRRs were near 1, except among Asian Americans (aRR 1.82 [1.23, 2.68]). These results indicate increased incidence of severe COVID-19 among Black/African American and Hispanic individuals is due to higher infection rates, not increased susceptibility to progression. COVID-19 disparities most likely result from social, not biological, factors. Future work should explore reasons for increased severe COVID-19 risk among Asian Americans.

This study applied a differential item functioning (DIF) framework to data from a sample of 6th and 8th grade students in the Seattle Public School District (N = 3,593) to investigate the measurement equivalence of the MFQ.

Comparisons of blood pressure between Asian-American children and children from other racial groups in Chicago.,"RESEARCHERS COMPARED AVERAGE BLOOD PRESSURE, prevalence of elevated blood pressure, and average anthropometric measurements of Asian children with those same measures in children from other racial and ethnic groups, including blacks, whites, and Hispanics. The sample consisted of 1318 boys and 1548 girls ages 6 to 9 who had complete blood pressure and anthropometric data, which were derived from a health screening program in nonpublic schools conducted by the Chicago Department of Health from 1975 to 1978. The systolic pressure, adjusted for age, weight, and height, for Asian, black, Hispanic, and white boys was 108.1, 105.8, 104.7, and 105.6 mmHg, and for diastolic pressure, the adjusted values were 59.6, 58.9, 56.3, and 57.4 mmHg. For both systolic and diastolic, the differences between Asian boys and white boys and between Asian boys and Hispanic boys were statistically significant. For girls, the results were similar. In addition, for boys, the prevalence rates of elevated blood pressure (systolic greater than or equal to 122 mmHg or diastolic greater than or equal to 78 mmHg) were similar among the four groups. For girls, the prevalence rate for Asians was higher than those in the other groups; however, the differences were not statistically significant. Since hypertension is a major health problem in Asians, it is important to confirm these findings and to understand why mean blood pressure adjusted for age and body size is higher in Asian children than in other racial groups.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)","[""researcher"", ""compare"", ""average"", ""blood"", ""pressure"", ""prevalence"", ""elevated"", ""blood"", ""pressure"", ""average"", ""anthropometric"", ""measurement"", ""asian"", ""child"", ""measure"", ""child"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""include"", ""black"", ""white"", ""hispanic"", ""sample"", ""consist"", ""1318"", ""boy"", ""1548"", ""girl"", ""age"", ""6"", ""9"", ""complete"", ""blood"", ""pressure"", ""anthropometric"", ""datum"", ""derive"", ""health"", ""screening"", ""program"", ""nonpublic"", ""school"", ""conduct"", ""chicago"", ""department"", ""health"", ""1975"", ""1978"", ""systolic"", ""pressure"", ""adjusted"", ""age"", ""weight"", ""height"", ""asian"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""boy"", ""108"", ""1"", ""105"", ""8"", ""104"", ""7"", ""105"", ""6"", ""mmhg"", ""diastolic"", ""pressure"", ""adjusted"", ""value"", ""59"", ""6"", ""58"", ""9"", ""56"", ""3"", ""57"", ""4"", ""mmhg"", ""systolic"", ""diastolic"", ""difference"", ""asian"", ""boy"", ""white"", ""boy"", ""asian"", ""boy"", ""hispanic"", ""boy"", ""statistically"", ""girl"", ""similar"", ""addition"", ""boy"", ""prevalence"", ""rate"", ""elevated"", ""blood"", ""pressure"", ""systolic"", ""great"", ""equal"", ""122"", ""mmhg"", ""diastolic"", ""great"", ""equal"", ""78"", ""mmhg"", ""similar"", ""among"", ""four"", ""group"", ""girl"", ""prevalence"", ""rate"", ""asian"", ""high"", ""group"", ""however"", ""difference"", ""statistically"", ""since"", ""hypertension"", ""major"", ""health"", ""problem"", ""asian"", ""important"", ""confirm"", ""finding"", ""understand"", ""mean"", ""blood"", ""pressure"", ""adjusted"", ""age"", ""body"", ""size"", ""high"", ""asian"", ""child"", ""racial"", ""group""]",None,None,None,"Asian, Hispanic"
Racial-Ethnic Variation in Park Use and Physical Activity in the City of Los Angeles.,"Racial-ethnic disparities in physical activity present important challenges to population health.

Here, we examine racial ethnic differences in park use and physical activity among adult residents (n = 7506) living within 1 mi of 50 parks in the city of Los Angeles. In multivariate analyses, we find few differences among race-ethnic groups in terms of their frequency of having visited the park in the past 7 days; however, we find numerous differences in how the groups used the park and in their levels of physical activity: Blacks and English-speaking Latinos were less likely than whites to report being physically active, exercising in the park, and exercising outside the park; Spanish-speaking Latinos were equally likely as whites to report exercising in park but less likely to report exercising outside the park and more likely to report using the parks for social interactions; Asians/Pacific Islanders (PI)/others were more likely than whites to report visiting the park in the past 7 days and using the parks for social interactions.

Racial and ethnic differences in the mental health needs and access to care of older adults in california.,"Little is known about the unmet mental health needs of minority older adults. Racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence rates of psychological distress and reported need and use of mental health services were examined in a population-based sample of older adults using the 2005 California Health Interview Survey. The sample comprised 16,974 people aged 55 and older, with 13,974 non-Hispanic whites, 719 African Americans, 1,215 Asians, and 1,066 Latinos. Respondents were compared in terms of prevalence of symptoms of mental distress and serious mental illness, reported need for help, and access to mental health services. African Americans, Asians, and Latinos were more likely to have mental distress than whites (21.2-24.2% vs 14.4%, P<.001) and a higher prevalence of serious mental illness (4.1-7.7% vs 2.5%, P<.001). After adjustment for age, sex, birthplace, marital status, education, limited English proficiency, chronic health conditions, and insurance status, older African-American (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-1.81) and Asian (aOR=1.50, CI=1.13-2.00) adults still had greater odds of mental distress than whites. Furthermore, all three groups had worse access to mental health services than whites (African American aOR=0.64, 95% CI=0.43-0.96; Asian aOR=0.32, CI=0.16-0.63; Latino aOR=0.35, CI=0.17-0.70).

Donor and Recipient Ethnicity Impacts Renal Graft Adverse Outcomes.,"Renal transplant outcomes have been shown to be impacted by ethnicity. Prior studies have evaluated the disparate transplant outcomes of Black recipients and recipients of Black donors. However, it has remained unclear whether other donor ethnicities independent of medical comorbidities can influence transplant outcomes. Utilizing the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) (with greater than 100,000 patients), we evaluated the effect of each ethnicity, Black, American Indian, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and Asian as compared to White recipients on adverse kidney transplant outcomes, assessing for delayed graft function, positive urine protein, acute rejection, and graft failure. Additionally, we assessed the interplay of donor ethnicity on recipient transplant outcomes, which has not previously been comprehensively examined. Logistic regression analysis that took into consideration gender, age, comorbidities, graft type, donor ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), HLA mismatch, ever been on hemodialysis, and time on dialysis indicates that Black recipients have worse outcomes compared to Whites in all outcomes assessed. A logistic regression analysis showed that recipient ethnicity was an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes. Notably, we found that donor ethnicity also independently affects graft outcomes. Hispanic donors lead to better outcomes in Whites and Blacks, while Asian donors have the best outcomes amongst Asian recipients. Recipients of Black donors fared the worst of all ethnicity donors. These data suggest the potential importance of risk stratification for the donor allograft and developing risk calculators that include both donor and recipient ethnicity may be useful, which the current Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) does not currently take into account as they give black donors a different weight, but the same score is assigned to Whites, Asians, and Hispanics.",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,"[""renal"", ""transplant"", ""outcome"", ""show"", ""impacted"", ""ethnicity"", ""prior"", ""study"", ""evaluate"", ""disparate"", ""transplant"", ""outcome"", ""black"", ""recipient"", ""recipient"", ""black"", ""donor"", ""however"", ""remain"", ""unclear"", ""whether"", ""donor"", ""ethnicity"", ""independent"", ""medical"", ""comorbiditie"", ""influence"", ""transplant"", ""outcome"", ""utilize"", ""scientific"", ""registry"", ""transplant"", ""recipient"", ""srtr"", ""great"", ""100"", ""000"", ""patient"", ""evaluate"", ""effect"", ""ethnicity"", ""black"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""hispanic"", ""native"", ""hawaiian"", ""pacific"", ""islander"", ""asian"", ""compare"", ""white"", ""recipient"", ""adverse"", ""kidney"", ""transplant"", ""outcome"", ""assess"", ""delay"", ""graft"", ""function"", ""positive"", ""urine"", ""protein"", ""acute"", ""rejection"", ""graft"", ""failure"", ""additionally"", ""assess"", ""interplay"", ""donor"", ""ethnicity"", ""recipient"", ""transplant"", ""outcome"", ""previously"", ""comprehensively"", ""examine"", ""logistic"", ""regression"", ""analysis"", ""take"", ""consideration"", ""gender"", ""age"", ""comorbiditie"", ""graft"", ""type"", ""donor"", ""ethnicity"", ""body"", ""mass"", ""index"", ""bmi"", ""hla"", ""mismatch"", ""ever"", ""hemodialysis"", ""time"", ""dialysis"", ""indicate"", ""black"", ""recipient"", ""bad"", ""outcome"", ""compare"", ""white"", ""outcome"", ""assess"", ""logistic"", ""regression"", ""analysis"", ""show"", ""recipient"", ""ethnicity"", ""independent"", ""risk"", ""factor"", ""adverse"", ""outcome"", ""notably"", ""find"", ""donor"", ""ethnicity"", ""also"", ""independently"", ""affect"", ""graft"", ""outcome"", ""hispanic"", ""donor"", ""lead"", ""well"", ""outcome"", ""white"", ""black"", ""asian"", ""donor"", ""good"", ""outcome"", ""amongst"", ""asian"", ""recipient"", ""recipient"", ""black"", ""donor"", ""fare"", ""bad"", ""ethnicity"", ""donor"", ""datum"", ""suggest"", ""potential"", ""importance"", ""risk"", ""stratification"", ""donor"", ""allograft"", ""develop"", ""risk"", ""calculator"", ""include"", ""donor"", ""recipient"", ""ethnicity"", ""may"", ""useful"", ""current"", ""kidney"", ""donor"", ""profile"", ""index"", ""kdpi"", ""currently"", ""take"", ""account"", ""give"", ""black"", ""donor"", ""different"", ""weight"", ""score"", ""assign"", ""white"", ""asian"", ""hispanic""]",None,None,None,"Black, Asian, Hispanic"

"Neighborhoods and mental health: exploring ethnic density, poverty, and social cohesion among Asian Americans and Latinos.","This study examines the associations of neighborhood ethnic density and poverty with social cohesion and self-rated mental health among Asian Americans and Latinos. Path analysis is employed to analyze data from the 2002-2003 National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS) and the 2000 U.S. Census (N = 2095 Asian Americans living in N = 259 neighborhoods; N = 2554 Latinos living in N = 317 neighborhoods). Findings reveal that neighborhood ethnic density relates to poor mental health in both groups. Social cohesion partially mediates that structural relationship, but is positively related to ethnic density among Latinos and negatively related to ethnic density among Asian Americans. Although higher neighborhood poverty is negatively associated with mental health for both groups, the relationship does not hold in the path models after accounting for social cohesion and covariates. Furthermore, social cohesion fully mediates the association between neighborhood poverty and mental health among Latinos.

Neighborhood context and racial/ethnic differences in young children's obesity: structural barriers to interventions.,"Numerous studies in the last ten years have investigated racial/ethnic disparities in obesity for young children. Increasing attention is paid to the influence of neighborhood environments - social and physical-on a variety of young children's health outcomes. This work identifies resource-based and community-based mechanisms that impede on the maintenance of healthy weights for young children in socioeconomically depressed areas, and shows consistently higher rates of obesity in more deprived areas. None of this work, however, has explored whether area deprivation or the race/nativity composition of neighborhoods contributes to racial/ethnic disparities in young children's obesity. Utilizing restricted geo-coded data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (Kindergarten) (N = 17,540), we utilize multilevel logistic regression models to show that neighborhood level measures do little to explain racial and ethnic differences in childhood obesity. However, living in neighborhoods with higher levels of poverty, lower levels of education, and a higher proportion of black residents is associated with increased child obesity risk after considering a host of relevant individual level factors. In addition, living in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of foreign-born residents is associated with reduced child obesity risk. Although well-intentioned childhood obesity intervention programs aimed at changing individual-level behaviors are important, our results highlight the importance of considering neighborhood structural factors for child obesity prevention.",Social science & medicine (1982),"[""numerous"", ""study"", ""last"", ""ten"", ""year"", ""investigate"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""obesity"", ""young"", ""child"", ""increase"", ""attention"", ""pay"", ""influence"", ""neighborhood"", ""environment"", ""social"", ""physical"", ""variety"", ""young"", ""child"", ""health"", ""outcome"", ""work"", ""identify"", ""resource"", ""base"", ""community"", ""based"", ""mechanism"", ""impede"", ""maintenance"", ""healthy"", ""weight"", ""young"", ""child"", ""socioeconomically"", ""depressed"", ""area"", ""show"", ""consistently"", ""high"", ""rate"", ""obesity"", ""deprived"", ""area"", ""none"", ""work"", ""however"", ""explore"", ""whether"", ""area"", ""deprivation"", ""race"", ""nativity"", ""composition"", ""neighborhood"", ""contribute"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""young"", ""child"", ""obesity"", ""utilize"", ""restricted"", ""geo"", ""code"", ""datum"", ""early"", ""childhood"", ""longitudinal"", ""kindergarten"", ""n"", ""17"", ""540"", ""utilize"", ""multilevel"", ""logistic"", ""regression"", ""model"", ""show"", ""neighborhood"", ""level"", ""measure"", ""little"", ""explain"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""childhood"", ""obesity"", ""however"", ""live"", ""neighborhood"", ""high"", ""level"", ""poverty"", ""low"", ""level"", ""education"", ""high"", ""proportion"", ""black"", ""resident"", ""associate"", ""increase"", ""child"", ""obesity"", ""risk"", ""consider"", ""host"", ""relevant"", ""individual"", ""level"", ""factor"", ""addition"", ""live"", ""neighborhood"", ""high"", ""proportion"", ""foreign"", ""bear"", ""resident"", ""associate"", ""reduce"", ""child"", ""obesity"", ""risk"", ""although"", ""well"", ""intentioned"", ""childhood"", ""obesity"", ""intervention"", ""program"", ""aim"", ""change"", ""individual"", ""level"", ""behavior"", ""important"", ""highlight"", ""importance"", ""consider"", ""neighborhood"", ""structural"", ""factor"", ""child"", ""obesity"", ""prevention""]",None,None,poverty,None

To better understand barriers to mammography, we conducted six focus groups with 49 women of minority races and ethnicities (19 Asian, 16 African-American, and 14 Hispanic) recruited from outpatient medical clinics in Boston. Eligible women had at least one prior mammogram and no personal history of cancer. Discussions were recorded and transcribed, and thematic content analyses were performed. African-Americans and Hispanics felt that lack of insurance was not a barrier to mammography as they were aware of free programs. Some African-Americans avoided mammograms because they were fatalistic and believed that a breast cancer diagnosis would inevitably lead to death. African-Americans agreed that social issues, such as drug and domestic abuse, made obtaining preventive health care less important. Asian participants agreed that mammogram return rates were poor because appointments took time away from work. Asian and Hispanic women identified discourteous behavior by hospital staff as a barrier. Cultural barriers to repeat mammography appear to vary among different racial groups.

To address this gap, we must better investigate the lived realities of racism in the gay community. In this study, we had the unique opportunity to examine experiences of racism among African American, Asian/Pacific Islander and Latino men who have sex with men living in Los Angeles through focus groups and individual in-depth interviews. We found three themes of racism: exclusion from West Hollywood and the mainstream gay community, sexual rejection based on race/ethnicity and sexual stereotypes. There were differences across the three racial groups in the experiences of each theme, however. We then considered how racism impacted partner selection and found that race played a salient role in determining power differentials within mixed-race partnerships.

Discrimination's role in minority groups' rates of substance-use disorder.,"This study asked whether, among the three largest American racial/ethnic minorities, presence/absence of current substance-use disorder is explained to any degree by social status and discrimination. It examined interaction effects involving discrimination and social status, exploring whether social-status factors are channeled through discrimination, fostering disorder. Logistic regression techniques were applied to data from the nationally representative dataset 2001-2003 Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys. Findings generally suggest that presence of substance-use disorder is likely to be associated with perceived discrimination. Significant interaction effects were also found: Discrimination's strongest association with substance-use disorder was observed for Asian respondents with lower incomes and for Hispanic respondents with little education. This study significantly expands knowledge, since little research preceding it directly addressed relationships among social-status factors, discrimination, and substance-use disorder in minority populations.

"Prostate cancer: trends in mortality and stage-specific incidence rates by racial/ethnic group in Los Angeles County, California (United States).","Between 1976 and 1988 in the United States, the secular trends to age-adjusted incidence rates of prostate cancer were significantly different by racial/ethnic group (P < 0.001), and increased significantly only among non-Hispanic Whites at a rate of 2.7 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 2.3-3.1%) annually. While incidence rates of regional disease increased significantly (7.7 percent to 11.3 percent annually) among all racial/ethnic groups during this period, localized disease increased significantly only among non-Hispanic Whites, by 1.8 percent (CI = 1.4-2.3%) annually. Prostate cancer mortality in Los Angeles County (California) remained constant among Hispanics, non-Hispanic Whites, and Asians, but increases 1.6 percent (CI = 0-3.2%) annually among Blacks. While the increase in localized disease rates of non-Hispanic Whites may be due to increased detection of asymptomatic disease, this apparently has not occurred among other racial/ethnic groups in Los Angeles County. The secular increase in regional disease rates among all racial/ethnic groups without a concurrent increase in mortality (except Blacks), suggests increased accuracy of staging rather than a true increase in incidence may account for these trends.

Gender Attitudes in Early Childhood: Behavioral Consequences and Cognitive Antecedents.,"This study examined factors that predicted children's gender intergroup attitudes at age 5 and the implications of these attitudes for intergroup behavior. Ethnically diverse children from low-income backgrounds (N = 246; Mexican-, Chinese-, Dominican-, and African American) were assessed at ages 4 and 5. On average, children reported positive same-gender and negative other-gender attitudes. Positive same-gender attitudes were associated with knowledge of gender stereotypes. In contrast, positive other-gender attitudes were associated with flexibility in gender cognitions (stereotype flexibility, gender consistency). Other-gender attitudes predicted gender-biased behavior. These patterns were observed in all ethnic groups.

It further examined the relationship between a school's racial climate gaps and achievement gaps and other school structures and norms that may help explain why some schools have larger or smaller racial disparities in student reports of climate than others. Multilevel regression results problematized the concept of a ""school climate"" by showing that, in an average middle school, Black and Hispanic students have less favorable experiences of safety, connectedness, relationships with adults, and opportunities for participation compared to White students. The results also show that certain racial school climate gaps vary in magnitude across middle schools, and in middle schools where these gaps are larger, the racial achievement gap is also larger.

In the high-prime condition, the authors exposed participants to stereotype words associated with the Yellow Peril view of Asian Americans. The authors exposed participants in a low-prime condition to neutral words. All participants then read a vignette and evaluated its protagonist on several social dimensions. Results indicated that the priming procedure effectively biased participant evaluation of the vignette target, but only on items closely linked to Asian Americans.

"Diagnostic attributions versus labeling: impact of Alzheimer's disease and major depression diagnoses on emotions, beliefs, and helping intentions of family members.","Labeling theory suggests that applying disease labels to behavior may serve to medicalize deviance and produce stigma. In contrast, attribution theory suggests that this practice may evoke sympathetic responses. Female undergraduates (N = 221) read vignettes describing an older parent exhibiting inappropriate behavior in a social situation, with diagnostic label (Alzheimer's disease, major depression, no label), personal congruence of the behavior (congruent, incongruent, no information), and parent gender manipulated across participants. Participants rated their emotional responses, attributions, and willingness to help.

"Dental morphology and ancestry in Albuquerque, New Mexico Hispanics.","The term ""Hispanic"" groups people from Central and South America and the Caribbean, combining disparate cultures, languages, and ancestry, and masking biological differences. Historical and current admixture patterns within these populations and with indigenous and European-, African-, and/or Asian- derived populations complicate the biological picture. Although ""Hispanic"" has little biological meaning, it is used widely in epidemiology, disease management, and forensics as a biologically significant group. An interdisciplinary approach combining historical, cultural, and biological data can characterize regional and temporal differences between Hispanic populations. We examined biological distances with a population of central New Mexico Hispanics, as a case study of the local specificity of population history. We collected dental morphological trait frequencies from samples of recent Albuquerque-area Hispanic Americans and several ancestral and contemporary groups. To explore regional admixture patterns we calculated biological distances using the modified Mahalanobis D(2) statistic. Our results indicate that Albuquerque Hispanics are more similar to their European and African ancestral groups than to Native Americans in New Mexico. Additionally, their affinity to Native Americans is greater with prehistoric rather than contemporary samples. We argue that these results reflect a local rather than pan-Hispanic admixture pattern; they underscore that populations are better understood at the local and regional levels. It is undesirable to make sweeping biological generalizations for groups known to be geographically and genetically disparate.

"The interaction of race, gender and social class effects in the education of deaf students.","While racial effects have been noted in the education of the deaf in a variety of ways, gender effects are difficult to identify and social class effects are not discussed at all. Further, it is possible that these effects interact to produce unique effects. To examine these issues, a re-analysis of data from a longitudinal study of 451 deaf adolescents in local public schools was conducted. Results support previous observations about racial and gender effects and suggest that social class is an effect in the education of the deaf. In addition, there is very limited evidence to suggest an interaction of the effects.

Disparities in burden of disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis across racial and ethnic groups.,"To examine racial/ethnic differences in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease burden and change in clinical outcomes over time. We included CorEvitas Rheumatoid Arthritis Registry patients from two time periods (2013-2015 and 2018-2020). Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) (as a continuous measure and as a dichotomous measure) and the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) were assessed at each visit. Marginal means and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) by race/ethnicity were estimated for each outcome using adjusted mixed effects linear and logistic regression models. Overall and pairwise tests were conducted to detect differences between race/ethnicity groups. Of 9,363 eligible patients (8,142 White, 527 Black, 545 Hispanic, 149 Asian), most (76%-85%) were female. At Visit 1, the mean disease duration ranged from 9.8-11.8 years. Estimated CDAI was significantly higher for Hispanics compared to Whites at Visit 1 (11.1 vs. 9.9; pairwise P = 0.033) and Visit 2 (9.2 vs. 8.0, pairwise P = 0.005). Disease activity improved over the 5-year study period among all race/ethnicity groups, though Hispanics improved less than Whites. Disease activity improved over the 5-year period across all racial/ethnicity groups, and disparities between racial/ethnicity groups in disease activity and functional status did persist over time, suggesting that further effort is needed to understand the drivers of these discrepancies to close this race/ethnicity gap.

Assessing parenting in racially and ethnically diverse families: A lack of measurement equivalence.,"The present study explored measurement invariance of the Multidimensional Assessment of Parenting Scale (MAPS; Parent & Forehand, 2017) across White, Hispanic, Black, and Asian American parents. Participants included 2,734 parents, 58% of whom were mothers. On average, parents were 36.32 years old (<i>SD</i> = 9.54); the parent sample was 66.9% White non-Hispanic, 10.1% Black, 5.3% Asian, and 17.7% Hispanic regardless of race. Child ages ranged from 3 to 17 years (<i>M</i> = 9.84, <i>SD</i> = 3.71), and 58% were identified as male. Parents completed a demographics questionnaire about themselves and their target child, and the 34-item MAPS. We explored measurement equivalence of the MAPS Broadband Positive and Negative parenting scales using item response theory to identify differential item functioning (DIF). Univariate analyses for Positive and Negative Parenting showed reliability was excellent. Twelve items assessing negative aspects of parenting exhibited bias by race/ethnicity. Specifically, when comparing racial and ethnic groups, three items had nonuniform DIF comparing Black and Asian participants, two items had nonuniform DIF comparing Black and Hispanic participants, and one item showed nonuniform DIF comparing Asian and Hispanic participants. When looking at Positive Parenting, no items showed evidence of DIF. Results from the present study suggest broadband Positive Parenting can be compared across ethnoracial groups, while findings raise concern about assessing Negative Parenting items when examining invariance across race and ethnicity. Findings from the present study imply that racial and ethnic comparisons are potentially invalid. These findings offer guidance for improving parenting assessment for racially/ethnically diverse populations.

"Immigrant residential segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas, 1990-2000.","This paper examines the extent of spatial assimilation among immigrants of different racial and ethnic origins. We use restricted data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses to calculate the levels of dissimilarity by race and Hispanic origin, nativity, and year of entry, and then run multivariate models to examine these relationships. The findings provide broad support for spatial assimilation theory. Foreign-born Hispanics, Asians, and blacks are more segregated from native-born non-Hispanic whites than are the U.S.-born of these groups. The patterns for Hispanics and Asians can be explained by the average characteristics of the foreign-born that are generally associated with higher levels of segregation, such as lower levels of income, English language ability, and home ownership. We also find that immigrants who have been in the United States for longer periods are generally less segregated than new arrivals, and once again, much of this difference can be attributed to the characteristics of immigrants. However, patterns also vary across groups. Levels of segregation are much higher for black immigrants than for Asian, Hispanic, and white immigrants. In addition, because black immigrants are, on average, of higher socioeconomic status than native-born blacks, such characteristics do not help explain their very high levels of segregation.",Demography,"[""paper"", ""examine"", ""extent"", ""spatial"", ""assimilation"", ""among"", ""immigrant"", ""different"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""origin"", ""use"", ""restricted"", ""datum"", ""1990"", ""2000"", ""census"", ""calculate"", ""level"", ""dissimilarity"", ""race"", ""hispanic"", ""origin"", ""nativity"", ""year"", ""entry"", ""run"", ""multivariate"", ""model"", ""examine"", ""relationship"", ""finding"", ""provide"", ""broad"", ""support"", ""spatial"", ""assimilation"", ""theory"", ""foreign"", ""bear"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""black"", ""segregate"", ""native"", ""bear"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""u"", ""born"", ""group"", ""pattern"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""explain"", ""average"", ""characteristic"", ""foreign"", ""bear"", ""generally"", ""associate"", ""high"", ""level"", ""segregation"", ""low"", ""level"", ""income"", ""english"", ""language"", ""ability"", ""home"", ""ownership"", ""also"", ""find"", ""immigrant"", ""united"", ""state"", ""long"", ""period"", ""generally"", ""less"", ""segregate"", ""new"", ""arrival"", ""much"", ""difference"", ""attribute"", ""characteristic"", ""immigrant"", ""however"", ""pattern"", ""also"", ""vary"", ""across"", ""group"", ""level"", ""segregation"", ""much"", ""high"", ""black"", ""immigrant"", ""asian"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""immigrant"", ""addition"", ""black"", ""immigrant"", ""average"", ""high"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""native"", ""bear"", ""black"", ""characteristic"", ""help"", ""explain"", ""high"", ""level"", ""segregation""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,"Asian, Hispanic"
Addressing Racial and Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Among School-Aged Children: Are We Doing Enough?,"The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 and associated disparities among Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native children and teenagers has been documented. Reducing these disparities along with overcoming unintended negative consequences of the pandemic, such as the disruption of in-person schooling, calls for broad community-based collaborations and nuanced approaches. Based on national survey data, children from some racial and ethnic minority groups have a higher prevalence of obesity, asthma, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension; were diagnosed more frequently with COVID-19; and had more severe outcomes compared with their non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts. Furthermore, a higher proportion of children from some racial and ethnic minority groups lived in families with incomes less than 200% of the federal poverty level or in households lacking secure employment compared with NHW children. Children from some racial and ethnic minority groups were also more likely to attend school via online learning compared with NHW counterparts. Because the root causes of these disparities are complex and multifactorial, an organized community-based approach is needed to achieve greater proactive and sustained collaborations between local health departments, local school systems, and other public and private organizations to pursue health equity. This article provides a summary of potential community-based health promotion strategies to address racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes and educational inequities among children and teens, specifically in the implementation of strategic partnerships, including initial collective work, outcomes-based activities, and communication. These collaborations can facilitate policy, systems, and environmental changes in school systems that support emergency preparedness, recovery, and resilience when faced with public health crises.",Preventing chronic disease,"[""disproportionate"", ""impact"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""associate"", ""disparity"", ""among"", ""hispanic"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""black"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""american"", ""indian"", ""alaska"", ""native"", ""child"", ""teenager"", ""document"", ""reduce"", ""disparity"", ""along"", ""overcome"", ""unintended"", ""negative"", ""consequence"", ""pandemic"", ""disruption"", ""person"", ""school"", ""call"", ""broad"", ""community"", ""base"", ""collaboration"", ""nuanced"", ""approach"", ""base"", ""national"", ""survey"", ""data"", ""child"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""group"", ""high"", ""prevalence"", ""obesity"", ""asthma"", ""type"", ""2"", ""diabetes"", ""hypertension"", ""diagnose"", ""frequently"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""severe"", ""outcome"", ""compare"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""nhw"", ""counterpart"", ""furthermore"", ""high"", ""proportion"", ""child"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""group"", ""live"", ""family"", ""income"", ""less"", ""200"", ""federal"", ""poverty"", ""level"", ""household"", ""lack"", ""secure"", ""employment"", ""compare"", ""nhw"", ""child"", ""child"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""group"", ""also"", ""likely"", ""attend"", ""school"", ""via"", ""online"", ""learning"", ""compare"", ""nhw"", ""counterpart"", ""root"", ""cause"", ""disparity"", ""complex"", ""multifactorial"", ""organize"", ""community"", ""based"", ""approach"", ""need"", ""achieve"", ""great"", ""proactive"", ""sustained"", ""collaboration"", ""local"", ""health"", ""department"", ""local"", ""school"", ""system"", ""public"", ""private"", ""organization"", ""pursue"", ""health"", ""equity"", ""article"", ""provide"", ""summary"", ""potential"", ""community"", ""base"", ""health"", ""promotion"", ""strategy"", ""address"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""covid"", ""19"", ""outcome"", ""educational"", ""inequity"", ""among"", ""child"", ""teen"", ""specifically"", ""implementation"", ""strategic"", ""partnership"", ""include"", ""initial"", ""collective"", ""work"", ""outcome"", ""base"", ""activity"", ""communication"", ""collaboration"", ""facilitate"", ""policy"", ""system"", ""environmental"", ""change"", ""school"", ""system"", ""support"", ""emergency"", ""preparedness"", ""recovery"", ""resilience"", ""face"", ""public"", ""health"", ""crisis""]",None,None,poverty,"Black, Hispanic"
Clarifying and measuring filial concepts across five cultural groups.,"Literature on responsibility of adult children for aging parents reflects lack of conceptual clarity. We examined filial concepts across five cultural groups: African-, Asian-, Euro-, Latino-, and Native Americans.

Confirmatory factor analysis on a 12-item final scale showed data fit the three-factor model better than a single factor solution despite substantial correlations between the factors (.82, .82 for Care with Responsibility and Respect, and .74 for Responsibility with Respect).

Responses to self-report questionnaires indicated that body surveillance and body shame were significantly positively correlated with contextual body concern during sexual activities for women of all ethnic groups. Examination of direct and indirect effects using structural equation modeling indicated that body shame partially mediated the relationship between body surveillance and contextual body image during sexual activity for the sample as a whole. However, multiple-group analyses (i.e., path invariance tests) showed that some of these relationships differed by ethnic group, with European American women reporting the strongest relationships.

Effects of range restriction and criterion contamination on differential validity of the SAT by race/ethnicity and sex.,"We illustrate the effects of range restriction and a form of criterion contamination (individual differences in course-taking patterns) on the validity of SAT scores for predicting college academic performance. College data facilitate exploration of differential validity's determinants because they (a) permit the use multivariate range-restriction corrections to more accurately account for differential range restriction across subgroups and (b) allow for separate examinations of composite performance and specific performance episodes, the latter of which controls for ecological contamination of composite performance due to individuals' choices of performance opportunities. Using data from 363,004 students at 107 U.S. institutions, we found that controlling for course-taking patterns resulted in validity coefficients that were appreciably larger than predictors' correlations with obtained grade point averages (GPAs). The validities of SAT scores for predicting the first-year college performance of Black and Hispanic students were not significantly different from the validity for White students after correcting for both course-taking patterns and differential range restriction, but significant Black-White differences were detected for predicting 4-year cumulative performance. Validity estimates for predicting both first-year and 4-year cumulative performance were significantly smaller among Asian students than White students after making these corrections. The SAT's observed validity for predicting college GPAs was substantially lower for males than females and, unexpectedly, controlling for course-taking patterns increased male-female validity differences.

Neighborhood characteristics as predictors of male to female and female to male partner violence.,"This article examines the association between neighborhood characteristics at the census tract-level, couples' perceived neighborhood social cohesion and informal social control, and male-to-female (MFPV) and female-to-male (FMPV) partner violence in the United States. Data come from a second wave of interviews (2000) with a national sample of couples 18 years of age and older who were first interviewed in 1995. The path analysis shows that poverty is associated with perceived social cohesion and perceived social control as hypothesized. However, there is no significant mediation effect for social control or social cohesion on any type of violence. In the path analysis, Black ethnicity is associated with social cohesion, which is associated with MFPV.

Racial/Ethnic Inequities in Low Birth Weight and Preterm Birth: The Role of Multiple Forms of Stress.,"Introduction Racial/ethnic inequities in low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB) persist in the United States. Research has identified numerous risk factors for adverse birth outcomes; however, they do not fully explain the occurrence of, or inequalities in PTB/LBW. Stress has been proposed as one explanation for differences in LBW and PTB by race/ethnicity. Methods Using the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data from 2012 to 2013 for 21 states and one city (n = 15,915) we used Poisson regression to estimate the association between acute, financial and relationship stressors and LBW and PTB, and to examine the contribution of these stressors individually and simultaneously to racial/ethnic differences in LBW and PTB. Results Adjusting for age and race/ethnicity, acute (p < 0.001), financial (p < 0.001) and relationship (p < 0.05) stressors were associated with increased risk of LBW, but only acute (p < 0.05) and financial (p < 0.01) stress increased risk of PTB. Across all models, non-Hispanic blacks had higher risk of LBW and PTB relative to non-Hispanic whites (IRR 1.87, 95% CI 1.55, 2.27 and IRR 1.46, 95% CI 1.18, 1.79). Accounting for the effects of stressors attenuated the risk of LBW and PTB by 17 and 22% respectively, but did not fully explain the increased likelihood of LBW and PTB among non-Hispanic blacks. Discussion Results of this study demonstrate that stress may increase the risk of LBW and PTB. While stressors may contribute to racial/ethnic differences in LBW and PTB, they do not fully explain them. Mitigating stress during pregnancy may help promote healthier birth outcomes and reduce racial/ethnic inequities in LBW and PTB.",Maternal and child health journal,"[""introduction"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""inequity"", ""low"", ""birth"", ""weight"", ""lbw"", ""preterm"", ""birth"", ""ptb"", ""persist"", ""united"", ""state"", ""research"", ""identify"", ""numerous"", ""risk"", ""factor"", ""adverse"", ""birth"", ""outcome"", ""however"", ""fully"", ""explain"", ""occurrence"", ""inequality"", ""ptb"", ""lbw"", ""stress"", ""propose"", ""one"", ""explanation"", ""difference"", ""lbw"", ""ptb"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""method"", ""use"", ""pregnancy"", ""risk"", ""assessment"", ""monitoring"", ""system"", ""pram"", ""datum"", ""2012"", ""2013"", ""21"", ""state"", ""one"", ""city"", ""n"", ""15"", ""915"", ""use"", ""poisson"", ""regression"", ""estimate"", ""association"", ""acute"", ""financial"", ""relationship"", ""stressor"", ""lbw"", ""ptb"", ""examine"", ""contribution"", ""stressor"", ""individually"", ""simultaneously"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""lbw"", ""ptb"", ""adjust"", ""age"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""acute"", ""p"", ""0"", ""001"", ""financial"", ""p"", ""0"", ""001"", ""relationship"", ""p"", ""0"", ""05"", ""stressor"", ""associate"", ""increase"", ""risk"", ""lbw"", ""acute"", ""p"", ""0"", ""05"", ""financial"", ""p"", ""0"", ""01"", ""stress"", ""increase"", ""risk"", ""ptb"", ""across"", ""model"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""black"", ""high"", ""risk"", ""lbw"", ""ptb"", ""relative"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""irr"", ""1"", ""87"", ""95"", ""ci"", ""1"", ""55"", ""2"", ""27"", ""irr"", ""1"", ""46"", ""95"", ""ci"", ""1"", ""18"", ""1"", ""79"", ""accounting"", ""effect"", ""stressor"", ""attenuate"", ""risk"", ""lbw"", ""ptb"", ""17"", ""22"", ""respectively"", ""fully"", ""explain"", ""increase"", ""likelihood"", ""lbw"", ""ptb"", ""among"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""black"", ""discussion"", ""demonstrate"", ""stress"", ""may"", ""increase"", ""risk"", ""lbw"", ""ptb"", ""stressor"", ""may"", ""contribute"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""lbw"", ""ptb"", ""fully"", ""explain"", ""mitigate"", ""stress"", ""pregnancy"", ""may"", ""help"", ""promote"", ""healthy"", ""birth"", ""outcome"", ""reduce"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""inequity"", ""lbw"", ""ptb""]",None,None,None,Hispanic

Cultural foods education: an exploratory study of dietitians and Plan IV programs in California.,"California dietitians require skills in working with the large ethnic populations in that state. Cultural foods education needs must be identified and evaluated so that they can be appropriately addressed in the nutrition and dietetics curriculums. Dietitians employed in California hospitals were surveyed to assess their cultural foods knowledge and determine cultural foods education needs. Demographic and opinion data were requested, and knowledge of the food habits of the six largest ethnic groups in the state was tested. California colleges and universities offering ADA Plan IV programs were sent questionnaires regarding the goals, content, and methodology of and the enrollment in cultural foods courses. Results of the dietitian survey (no. = 184; response rate 51%) showed a positive association (p less than .05) between the total score on the cultural foods knowledge test (average score = 62% correct) and completion of a college cultural foods course. Results of the Plan IV program survey (no. = 16; response rate 93%) indicate that 86% of the colleges and universities offer at least one cultural foods course. In 53% of those colleges and universities, Plan IV students are required to take such a course. Course content corresponds well to needs identified in the answers to the dietitian questionnaire.

"Adolescent work intensity, school performance, and substance use: links vary by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.","High school students who spend long hours in paid employment during the school year are at increased risk of lower grades and higher substance use, although questions remain about whether these linkages reflect causation or prior differences (selection effects). Questions also remain about whether such associations vary by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity. This study examines those questions using nationally representative data from two decades (1991-2010) of annual Monitoring the Future surveys involving about 600,000 students in 10th and 12th grades. White students are consistently more likely than minority students to hold paid employment during the school year. Among White and Asian American students, paid work intensity is negatively related to parental education and grade point averages (GPA) and is positively related to substance use. Also among Whites and Asian Americans, students with the most highly educated parents show the strongest negative relations between work intensity and GPA, whereas the links are weaker for those with less educated parents (i.e., lower SES levels). All of these relations are less evident for Hispanic students and still less evident for African American students. It thus appears that any costs possibly attributable to long hours of student work are most severe for those who are most advantaged--White or Asian American students with highly educated parents. Working long hours is linked with fewer disadvantages among Hispanic students and especially among African American students.

Variations in hip fracture hospitalization rates among different race/ethnicity groups in New York City.,"Hip fractures are a major cause of death and disability among the elderly. Although previous studies have shown hip fracture rates to be highest among Whites, and lowest among Blacks, less is known about how these differences are affected by gender and age. We determined the hip fracture hospitalization rates for non-Hispanic Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in New York City from 1988 to 2002 using Statewide Planning and Resource Cooperative System data from the New York state Department of Health. We found that hip fracture hospitalization rates for those aged 50 and older were higher for women than men, with a risk ratio of 1.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.73-1.77). Annual age-adjusted hip fracture hospitalization rates among White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian women were 459, 137, 143, and 174 per 100,000, respectively. The corresponding rates for men were 230, 109, 87, and 104, respectively. For both genders, and all race/ethnicity groups, the rates increased sharply with age. Although overall, women had higher rates compared to men, these differences varied by race and age. For Whites and Asians, women had higher rates for all age groups older than 50 years. For Hispanics aged 50-59, men had a higher rate than did women, but this gender relationship reversed after age 60. For Blacks, however, men had higher rates than women until age 70, after which women had higher rates. These results demonstrate that race/ethnicity, as well as age and gender, influence the incidence of hip fractures. Moreover, Asians, with their low bone mass, showed no increased hip fractures, compared to non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics. Further study is needed to explain this paradox.",Ethnicity & disease,"[""hip"", ""fracture"", ""major"", ""cause"", ""death"", ""disability"", ""among"", ""elderly"", ""although"", ""previous"", ""study"", ""show"", ""hip"", ""fracture"", ""rate"", ""high"", ""among"", ""white"", ""low"", ""among"", ""black"", ""less"", ""known"", ""difference"", ""affect"", ""gender"", ""age"", ""determine"", ""hip"", ""fracture"", ""hospitalization"", ""rate"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""new"", ""york"", ""city"", ""1988"", ""2002"", ""use"", ""statewide"", ""planning"", ""resource"", ""cooperative"", ""system"", ""data"", ""new"", ""york"", ""state"", ""department"", ""health"", ""find"", ""hip"", ""fracture"", ""hospitalization"", ""rate"", ""aged"", ""50"", ""old"", ""high"", ""woman"", ""man"", ""risk"", ""ratio"", ""1"", ""75"", ""95"", ""confidence"", ""interval"", ""ci"", ""1"", ""73"", ""1"", ""77"", ""annual"", ""age"", ""adjusted"", ""hip"", ""fracture"", ""hospitalization"", ""rate"", ""among"", ""white"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""woman"", ""459"", ""137"", ""143"", ""174"", ""per"", ""100"", ""000"", ""respectively"", ""corresponding"", ""rate"", ""man"", ""230"", ""109"", ""87"", ""104"", ""respectively"", ""gender"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""group"", ""rate"", ""increase"", ""sharply"", ""age"", ""although"", ""overall"", ""woman"", ""high"", ""rate"", ""compare"", ""man"", ""difference"", ""varied"", ""race"", ""age"", ""white"", ""asian"", ""woman"", ""high"", ""rate"", ""age"", ""group"", ""old"", ""50"", ""year"", ""hispanic"", ""aged"", ""50"", ""59"", ""man"", ""high"", ""rate"", ""woman"", ""gender"", ""relationship"", ""reverse"", ""age"", ""60"", ""black"", ""however"", ""man"", ""high"", ""rate"", ""woman"", ""age"", ""70"", ""woman"", ""high"", ""rate"", ""demonstrate"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""well"", ""age"", ""gender"", ""influence"", ""incidence"", ""hip"", ""fracture"", ""moreover"", ""asian"", ""low"", ""bone"", ""mass"", ""show"", ""increase"", ""hip"", ""fracture"", ""compare"", ""non"", ""hispanic"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""need"", ""explain"", ""paradox""]",None,None,None,"Black, Asian, Hispanic"
Racial/Ethnic Differences in Cardiovascular Symptoms in Four Major Racial/Ethnic Groups of Midlife Women: A Secondary Analysis.,"Ethnic minority midlife women frequently do not recognize cardiovascular symptoms that they experience during the menopausal transition. Racial/ethnic differences in cardiovascular symptoms are postulated as a plausible reason for their lack of knowledge and recognition of the symptoms. The purpose of this study was to explore racial/ethnic differences in midlife women's cardiovascular symptoms and to determine the factors related to these symptoms in each racial/ethnic group. This was a secondary analysis of the data from a larger study among 466 participants, collected from 2006 to 2011. The instruments included questions on background characteristics, health and menopausal status, and the Cardiovascular Symptom Index for Midlife Women. The data were analyzed using inferential statistics, including Poisson regression and logistic regression analyses. Significant racial/ethnic differences were observed in the total numbers and total severity scores of cardiovascular symptoms (p < .01). Non-Hispanic Asians had significantly lower total numbers and total severity scores compared to other racial/ethnic groups (p < .05).

"Status inequalities, perceived discrimination, and eudaimonic well-being: do the challenges of minority life hone purpose and growth?","Considerable prior research has investigated links between racial/ethnic status and diverse aspects of mental functioning (e.g. psychological disorders, quality of life, self-esteem), but little work has probed the connections between minority status and eudaimonic well-being. Derived from existential and humanistic perspectives, eudaimonia describes engagement in life challenges and is operationalized with assessments of purpose in life, personal growth, autonomy, environmental mastery, self-acceptance, and positive relations with others. Using Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), a national survey of Americans aged 25-74, plus city-specific samples of African Americans in New York City and Mexican Americans in Chicago, minority status was found to be a positive predictor of eudaimonic well-being, underscoring themes of psychological strength in the face of race-related adversity. Perceived discrimination was found to be a negative predictor of eudaimonic well-being, although such effects were gender-specific: it was women, both majority and minority, with high levels of discrimination in their daily lives whose sense of growth, mastery, autonomy, and self-acceptance was compromised.",Journal of health and social behavior,"[""considerable"", ""prior"", ""research"", ""investigate"", ""link"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""status"", ""diverse"", ""aspect"", ""mental"", ""function"", ""e"", ""g"", ""psychological"", ""disorder"", ""quality"", ""life"", ""self"", ""esteem"", ""little"", ""work"", ""probe"", ""connection"", ""minority"", ""status"", ""eudaimonic"", ""well"", ""derive"", ""existential"", ""humanistic"", ""perspective"", ""eudaimonia"", ""describe"", ""engagement"", ""life"", ""challenge"", ""operationalize"", ""assessment"", ""purpose"", ""life"", ""personal"", ""growth"", ""autonomy"", ""environmental"", ""mastery"", ""self"", ""acceptance"", ""positive"", ""relation"", ""other"", ""use"", ""midlife"", ""united"", ""state"", ""midus"", ""national"", ""survey"", ""american"", ""aged"", ""25"", ""74"", ""plus"", ""city"", ""specific"", ""sample"", ""african"", ""american"", ""new"", ""york"", ""city"", ""mexican"", ""american"", ""chicago"", ""minority"", ""status"", ""find"", ""positive"", ""predictor"", ""eudaimonic"", ""well"", ""underscore"", ""theme"", ""psychological"", ""strength"", ""face"", ""race"", ""related"", ""adversity"", ""perceived"", ""discrimination"", ""find"", ""negative"", ""predictor"", ""eudaimonic"", ""well"", ""although"", ""effect"", ""gender"", ""specific"", ""woman"", ""majority"", ""minority"", ""high"", ""level"", ""discrimination"", ""daily"", ""live"", ""whose"", ""sense"", ""growth"", ""mastery"", ""autonomy"", ""self"", ""acceptance"", ""compromise""]",None,None,None,None

"Trends in tuberculosis - United States, 2013.","In 2013, a total of 9,588 new tuberculosis (TB) cases were reported in the United States, with an incidence rate of 3.0 cases per 100,000 population, a decrease of 4.2% from 2012. This report summarizes provisional TB surveillance data reported to CDC in 2013. Although case counts and incidence rates continue to decline, certain populations are disproportionately affected. The TB incidence rate among foreign-born persons in 2013 was approximately 13 times greater than the incidence rate among U.S.-born persons, and the proportion of TB cases occurring in foreign-born persons continues to increase, reaching 64.6% in 2013. Racial/ethnic disparities in TB incidence persist, with TB rates among non-Hispanic Asians almost 26 times greater than among non-Hispanic whites. Four states (California, Texas, New York, and Florida), home to approximately one third of the U.S. population, accounted for approximately half the TB cases reported in 2013. The proportion of TB cases occurring in these four states increased from 49.9% in 2012 to 51.3% in 2013.

Immigration Transition and Cognitive Symptoms During Menopausal Transition.,"Many studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of cultural influences on menopausal symptoms; however, associations between immigration transition and cognitive symptoms have rarely been uncovered. This secondary analysis aimed to determine these associations among 1,054 midlife women in the United States using the data from two national Internet surveys. The surveys included multiple questions on immigration transition, health and menopausal status, and the Cognitive Symptom Index for Midlife Women. The data analysis was performed using descriptive and inferential statistics including hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Nonimmigrants had larger numbers and higher severity scores of total cognitive symptoms than immigrants (<i>p</i> < .001). Immigration status explained 1.28% of the total variances in the total numbers and 1.46% of the total variances in the total severity scores of total cognitive symptoms (<i>p</i> < .001).

"Intent to quit, quit attempts, and perceived health risk reduction among African American, Latino, and White nondaily and daily smokers in the United States.","<b>Objective:</b> Ethnic and racial differences in smoking patterns and behaviors have been well documented and most African American and Latino smokers are nondaily or light smokers. However, differences within smoking levels are understudied. Our primary aim was to determine whether there are racial and ethnic differences among African American, Latino, and White nondaily, light daily, and moderate to heavy daily smokers on (1) perceived health risk reduction, (2) intentions to quit, and (3) past year quit attempts. <b>Design:</b> Smokers were recruited through an online research panel for a cross-sectional survey (<i>n</i> = 2376). Sampling quotas were used to obtain equal numbers of African American, Latino, and White nondaily and daily smokers. <b>Results:</b> African American (59.6%) and Latino (54%) nondaily smokers were more likely than White nondaily smokers (45%) to currently limit their cigarettes per day (cpd) as a perceived health risk reduction strategy (<i>p </i>< 0.05). African American nondaily smokers were more likely than Latino and White nondaily smokers (<i>p</i> < 0.05) to limit their smoking in the past year as a perceived health risk reduction strategy (range: 0 'never' to 5 'always'; Means = 3.2, 2.9, 3.0, standard deviations [SD] = 1.1, 1.1, 1.2, respectively). African American nondaily smokers (15%) were more likely than either Latinos (7.8%) or Whites (8.5%) to intend to quit in the next 30 days (<i>p </i>< 0.01). African American (61.6%) and Latino (60.3%) nondaily smokers were more likely than Whites (49%) to have made a quit attempt in the past year (<i>p </i>< 0.01). Fewer racial and ethnic differences were found among daily smokers. <b>Conclusions:</b> Racial and ethnic group differences were more pronounced among nondaily smokers compared to light daily smoker and moderate to heavy daily smokers.

Social determinants of adolescent depression: an examination of racial differences.,"Conventional behavior theories that assert adolescent risk behaviors are determined by peer and parental relationships are being challenged as research begins to consider broader socioenvironmental factors. This study, using data from the Longitudinal Study for Adolescent Health (Add Health), Wave II, Public Use Data, and the Social Determinants of Adolescent Risk Behaviors (SDOARB) framework, examines relationships among socioeconomic status (SES), academic performance, perceived peer prejudice, and perceived teacher discrimination as predictors of depressive symptoms among high school adolescents. Overall, the study found that GPA was a significant predictor of depressive symptoms across all three racial groups (Black, White, and Other Minority). Teacher discrimination predicted depressive symptoms among White and Other minority adolescents, but not Black adolescents. These findings suggest the need for interventions within schools for both students and teachers around racial differences in perceptions of prejudice and discrimination.

Changes in profiles of students admitted to Florida allopathic medical schools 1990-1996.,"The demographic and academic profiles of first-year classes entering the three allopathic medical schools in Florida (UM, UF, and USF) between 1990 and 1996 have been summarized. In general, the high academic standards for admission (high GPAs and MCAT scores) have been maintained, and in some cases, increased. The percentages of women admitted to the first-year classes at UM and UF have increased in recent years, and the number of women enrolled in MD programs in Florida has increased by 26% since 1990. At the University of Miami, the student body has reached gender parity. There also has been a marked shift in the ethnicity of medical students in the state of Florida. Non-hispanic white students have decreased by 9% to 64.4% of the total population. Black students and hispanic students have made modest gains, and now constitute 7.4% and 11.5% of the population, respectively. Asian students have made the largest gain (6.4%), now making up 15.8% of all Florida medical students.

Can family socioeconomic resources account for racial and ethnic test score gaps?,"This article considers whether the disparate socioeconomic circumstances of families in which white, black, and Hispanic children grow up account for the racial and ethnic gaps in school readiness among American preschoolers. It first reviews why family socioeconomic resources might matter for children's school readiness. The authors concentrate on four key components of parent socioeconomic status that are particularly relevant for children's well-being--income, education, family structure, and neighborhood conditions. They survey a range of relevant policies and programs that might help to close socioeconomic gaps, for example, by increasing family incomes or maternal educational attainment, strengthening families, and improving poor neighborhoods. Their survey of links between socioeconomic resources and test score gaps indicates that resource differences account for about half of the standard deviation-about 8 points on a test with a standard deviation of 15-of the differences. Yet, the policy implications of this are far from clear. They note that although policies are designed to improve aspects of ""socioeconomic status"" (for example, income, education, family structure), no policy improves ""socioeconomic status"" directly. Second, they caution that good policy is based on an understanding of causal relationships between family background and children outcomes, as well as cost-effectiveness. They conclude that boosting the family incomes of preschool children may be a promising intervention to reduce racial and ethnic school readiness gaps. However, given the lack of successful large-scale interventions, the authors suggest giving only a modest role to programs that address parents' socioeconomic resources. They suggest that policies that directly target children may be the most efficient way to narrow school readiness gaps.",The Future of children,"[""article"", ""consider"", ""whether"", ""disparate"", ""socioeconomic"", ""circumstance"", ""familie"", ""white"", ""black"", ""hispanic"", ""child"", ""grow"", ""account"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""gap"", ""school"", ""readiness"", ""among"", ""american"", ""preschooler"", ""first"", ""review"", ""family"", ""socioeconomic"", ""resource"", ""might"", ""matter"", ""child"", ""school"", ""readiness"", ""author"", ""concentrate"", ""four"", ""key"", ""component"", ""parent"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""particularly"", ""relevant"", ""child"", ""well"", ""income"", ""education"", ""family"", ""structure"", ""neighborhood"", ""condition"", ""survey"", ""range"", ""relevant"", ""policy"", ""program"", ""might"", ""help"", ""close"", ""socioeconomic"", ""gap"", ""example"", ""increase"", ""family"", ""income"", ""maternal"", ""educational"", ""attainment"", ""strengthen"", ""family"", ""improve"", ""poor"", ""neighborhood"", ""survey"", ""link"", ""socioeconomic"", ""resource"", ""test"", ""score"", ""gap"", ""indicate"", ""resource"", ""difference"", ""account"", ""half"", ""standard"", ""deviation"", ""8"", ""point"", ""test"", ""standard"", ""deviation"", ""15"", ""difference"", ""yet"", ""policy"", ""implication"", ""far"", ""clear"", ""note"", ""although"", ""policy"", ""design"", ""improve"", ""aspect"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""example"", ""income"", ""education"", ""family"", ""structure"", ""policy"", ""improve"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""directly"", ""second"", ""caution"", ""good"", ""policy"", ""base"", ""understand"", ""causal"", ""relationship"", ""family"", ""background"", ""child"", ""outcome"", ""well"", ""cost"", ""effectiveness"", ""conclude"", ""boost"", ""family"", ""income"", ""preschool"", ""child"", ""may"", ""promising"", ""intervention"", ""reduce"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""school"", ""readiness"", ""gap"", ""however"", ""give"", ""lack"", ""successful"", ""large"", ""scale"", ""intervention"", ""author"", ""suggest"", ""give"", ""modest"", ""role"", ""program"", ""address"", ""parent"", ""socioeconomic"", ""resource"", ""suggest"", ""policy"", ""directly"", ""target"", ""child"", ""may"", ""efficient"", ""way"", ""narrow"", ""school"", ""readiness"", ""gap""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,Hispanic

"Race, socioeconomic status, and the use of bariatric surgery in Michigan.","Studies examining the characteristics of patients undergoing bariatric surgery in the USA have concluded that the procedure is not being used equitably. We used population-based data from Michigan to explore disparities in the use of bariatric surgery by gender, race, and socioeconomic status. We constructed a summary measure of socioeconomic status (SES) for Michigan postal ZIP codes using data from the 2000 census and divided the population into quintiles according to SES. We then used data from the state drivers' license list and 2004-2005 state inpatient and ambulatory surgery databases to examine population-based rates of morbid obesity and bariatric surgery in adults according to gender, race, and socioeconomic status. There is an inverse linear relationship between SES and morbid obesity. In the lowest SES quintile, 13% of females and 7% of males have a body mass index >40 compared to 4% of females and males in the highest SES quintile. Overall rates of bariatric surgery were highest for black females (29.4/10,000), followed by white (21.3/10,000), and other racial minority (8.6/10,000) females. Rates of bariatric surgery were low (<6/10,000) for males of all racial groups. An inverse linear relationship was observed between SES and rates of bariatric surgery among whites.

Analyses using the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality consider the extent to which a network contact's influence level affects a job applicant's pay, whether this effect differs for white, black, and Latino contacts, and how workplace racial context moderates this relationship. Three main findings emerge. First, having an influential contact--one with hiring authority--compared to having no contact yields higher pay. Second, white and minority contact influence on pay differs: among minority contacts, being an outsider (i.e., someone not employed by the firm to which the applicant applies) is associated with higher pay, but being an employee of the firm--an insider--is not. Third, regardless of workplace racial context, black and Latino contacts' influence is most beneficial when their race/ethnicity is not known to the hiring agent.

Experiences of Discrimination and Incident Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).,"Experiences of discrimination are associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes; however, it is unknown whether discrimination is related to incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (diabetes).

Using Cox proportional hazards models, we estimated hazard ratios and confidence intervals, adjusting for demographic factors, depressive symptoms, stress, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, diet, waist circumference, and body mass index. Over a median follow-up of 9.4 years, 654 diabetes cases were accrued. Major experiences of discrimination were associated with greater risk of incident diabetes when modeled continuously (for each additional experience of discrimination, hazard ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.17) or categorically (for ≥2 experiences vs. 0, hazard ratio = 1.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.08, 1.66). Similar patterns were observed when evaluating discrimination attributed to race/ethnicity or to a combination of other sources. Everyday discrimination was not associated with incident diabetes.

An Investigation of Racial and Ethnic Homophily on Grindr Among an Ongoing Cohort Study of YMSM.,"Men who have sex with men (MSM), and especially MSM of color, are disproportionately affected by HIV. Previous research shows that MSM have high levels of racial/ethnic homophily (the tendency for people to have sex with others who share the same racial/ethnic identification) in sexual dyads, which may help explain HIV disparities. This study fills a gap in previous research by grounding network data from a cohort study of young MSM in Chicago (RADAR) in the contexts of virtual spaces (VSs) and examining differences in levels of racial/ethnic homophily using multilevel-logistic-regression models. Results show that Grindr differs from other VSs in proportions of racially/ethnically homophilous dyads and by partner racial/ethnic identification.

"Prevalence of Perceived Food and Housing Security - 15 States, 2013.","Recent global (1) and national (2,3) health equity initiatives conclude that the elimination of health disparities requires improved understanding of social context (4,5) and ability to measure social determinants of health, including food and housing security (3). Food and housing security reflect the availability of and access to essential resources needed to lead a healthy life. The 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) included two questions to assess perceived food and housing security in 15 states.* Among 95,665 respondents, the proportion who answered ""never or rarely"" to the question ""how often in the past 12 months would you say you were worried or stressed about having enough money to buy nutritious meals?"" ranged from 68.5% to 82.4% by state. Among 90,291 respondents living in housing they either owned or rented, the proportion who answered ""never or rarely"" to the question, ""how often in the past 12 months would you say you were worried or stressed about having enough money to pay your rent/mortgage?"" ranged from 59.9% to 72.8% by state. Food security was reported less often among non-Hispanic blacks (blacks) (68.5%) and Hispanics (64.6%) than non-Hispanic whites (whites) (81.8%). These racial/ethnic disparities were present across all levels of education; housing security followed a similar pattern. These results highlight racial/ethnic disparities in two important social determinants of health, food and housing security, as well as a substantial prevalence of worry or stress about food or housing among all subgroups in the United States. The concise nature of the BRFSS Social Context Module's single-question format for food and housing security makes it possible to incorporate these questions into large health surveys so that social determinants can be monitored at the state and national levels and populations at risk can be identified.",MMWR.

Both the number of working hours per week and race/ethnicity were assessed as moderators using multiplicative interaction terms. Multiple jobholding was not associated with hypertension among women. However, there was a significant three-way interaction such that multiple jobholding was associated with hypertension among non-Hispanic Black men who worked ≥55 hours per week (relative risk = 1.02, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.05). The results suggest that the associations between multiple jobholding, number of working hours, and hypertension should be examined at the intersection of race/ethnicity and sex.

Knowledge of Abortion Laws and Services Among Low-Income Women in Three United States Cities.,"Low-income women and women of color are disproportionately affected by unintended pregnancy. Lack of knowledge of abortion laws and services is one of several factors likely to hinder access to services, though little research has documented knowledge in this population. Survey with convenience sample of 1,262 women attending primary care or full-scope Ob/Gyn clinics serving low-income populations in three large cities and multivariable analyses with four knowledge outcomes. Among all participants, 53% were first-generation immigrants, 25% identified the correct gestational age limit, 41% identified state parental consent laws, 67% knew partner consent is not required, and 55% knew where to obtain abortion services. In multivariable analysis, first-generation immigrants and primarily Spanish speakers were significantly less likely than higher-generation or primarily English speakers to display correct knowledge.

Suicide and ethnicity in the United States. Committee on Cultural Psychiatry. Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry.,"In the preceding chapters we have reviewed the available data on suicide among four major ethnic groups in the United States. In this final chapter, we wish to draw together the thematic threads observed in several of the groups we have studied. We also wish to point out thematic differences in the suicide data among the four groups studied and the possible significance of these differences. The most striking common theme that emerges from the analysis of suicide data for the four ethnic groups is the finding that suicide occurs most frequently among youth and young adults, and predominantly among young men. This is the case for Blacks, Native Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Mexican-Americans. The data for Japanese-Americans, showing a minor peak of suicide in young adulthood, allow some consideration of this general theme for this ethnic group as well. A notable exception is the Chinese-American group. A second major theme is the low rate of suicide among Black, Native American, Puerto Rican, and Mexican-American women, compared with males of this age group and compared with the majority population. Here, too, Chinese-American women are a dramatic exception, with peak suicide incidence occurring in older women. A third common theme is the comparatively low rate of suicide among older people in three of the four ethnic groups: Blacks, Native Americans, and Hispanics--both Puerto Ricans and Mexican-Americans. There are important differences in frequency of suicide between the majority population and the ethnic groups, but these differences are not consistent for the four ethnic groups studied. Most dramatic are the substantially higher aggregate rate of suicide among Native Americans than that which occurs among the majority population and the lower rates among Blacks, Puerto Ricans, and Mexican-Americans. The rates for Chinese- and Japanese-Americans are lower than the national figures, but not strikingly dissimilar. It is important to highlight the notion that no explanatory theory by itself accounts in a consistent way for the differences in suicide rates between the majority, White US population and the four ethnic groups we have studied.",Report (Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry : 1984),"[""precede"", ""chapter"", ""review"", ""available"", ""datum"", ""suicide"", ""among"", ""four"", ""major"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""unite"", ""state"", ""final"", ""chapter"", ""wish"", ""draw"", ""together"", ""thematic"", ""thread"", ""observe"", ""several"", ""group"", ""study"", ""also"", ""wish"", ""point"", ""thematic"", ""difference"", ""suicide"", ""datum"", ""among"", ""four"", ""group"", ""study"", ""possible"", ""significance"", ""difference"", ""strike"", ""common"", ""theme"", ""emerge"", ""analysis"", ""suicide"", ""datum"", ""four"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""find"", ""suicide"", ""occur"", ""frequently"", ""among"", ""youth"", ""young"", ""adult"", ""predominantly"", ""among"", ""young"", ""man"", ""case"", ""black"", ""native"", ""american"", ""puerto"", ""rican"", ""mexican"", ""american"", ""data"", ""japanese"", ""american"", ""show"", ""minor"", ""peak"", ""suicide"", ""young"", ""adulthood"", ""allow"", ""consideration"", ""general"", ""theme"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""well"", ""notable"", ""exception"", ""chinese"", ""american"", ""group"", ""second"", ""major"", ""theme"", ""low"", ""rate"", ""suicide"", ""among"", ""black"", ""native"", ""american"", ""puerto"", ""rican"", ""mexican"", ""american"", ""woman"", ""compare"", ""male"", ""age"", ""group"", ""compare"", ""majority"", ""population"", ""chinese"", ""american"", ""woman"", ""dramatic"", ""exception"", ""peak"", ""suicide"", ""incidence"", ""occur"", ""old"", ""woman"", ""third"", ""common"", ""theme"", ""comparatively"", ""low"", ""rate"", ""suicide"", ""among"", ""old"", ""people"", ""three"", ""four"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""black"", ""native"", ""american"", ""hispanic"", ""puerto"", ""rican"", ""mexican"", ""american"", ""important"", ""difference"", ""frequency"", ""suicide"", ""majority"", ""population"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""difference"", ""consistent"", ""four"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""study"", ""dramatic"", ""substantially"", ""high"", ""aggregate"", ""rate"", ""suicide"", ""among"", ""native"", ""american"", ""occur"", ""among"", ""majority"", ""population"", ""low"", ""rate"", ""among"", ""black"", ""puerto"", ""rican"", ""mexican"", ""american"", ""rate"", ""chinese"", ""japanese"", ""american"", ""low"", ""national"", ""figure"", ""strikingly"", ""dissimilar"", ""important"", ""highlight"", ""notion"", ""explanatory"", ""theory"", ""account"", ""consistent"", ""way"", ""difference"", ""suicide"", ""rate"", ""majority"", ""white"", ""we"", ""population"", ""four"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""study""]",suicide,None,None,"Black, Native American, Hispanic"
Racial and ethnic disparities in personal capital during pregnancy: findings from the 2007 Los Angeles Mommy and Baby (LAMB) study.,"The objectives of this study were to determine if racial and ethnic differences in personal capital during pregnancy exist and to estimate the extent to which any identified racial and ethnic differences in personal capital are related to differences in maternal sociodemographic and acculturation characteristics. Data are from the 2007 Los Angeles Mommy and Baby study (n = 3,716). Personal capital comprised internal resources (self-esteem and mastery) and social resources (partner, social network, and neighborhood support) during pregnancy. The relationships between race/ethnicity and personal capital were assessed using multivariable generalized linear models, examining the impact of sociodemographic and acculturation factors on these relationships. Significant racial and ethnic disparities in personal capital during pregnancy exist. However, socioeconomic status (i.e., income and education) and marital status completely explained Black-White disparities and Hispanic-White disparities in personal capital, whereas acculturation factors, especially nativity and language spoken at home, partially mediated the disparities in personal capital between Asian/Pacific Islander women and White women. Findings suggest that the risks associated with low socioeconomic status, single motherhood, and low acculturation, rather than race or ethnicity, contribute to low personal capital for many pregnant women. As personal capital during pregnancy may influence subsequent maternal and child health outcomes, the development of interventions should consider addressing sociodemographic and acculturation factors in order to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in personal capital and ultimately in poor maternal and child health outcomes.",Maternal and child health journal,"[""objective"", ""determine"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""personal"", ""capital"", ""pregnancy"", ""exist"", ""estimate"", ""extent"", ""identify"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""personal"", ""capital"", ""related"", ""difference"", ""maternal"", ""sociodemographic"", ""acculturation"", ""characteristic"", ""datum"", ""2007"", ""los"", ""angele"", ""mommy"", ""baby"", ""n"", ""3"", ""716"", ""personal"", ""capital"", ""comprise"", ""internal"", ""resource"", ""self"", ""esteem"", ""mastery"", ""social"", ""resource"", ""partner"", ""social"", ""network"", ""neighborhood"", ""support"", ""pregnancy"", ""relationship"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""personal"", ""capital"", ""assess"", ""use"", ""multivariable"", ""generalize"", ""linear"", ""model"", ""examine"", ""impact"", ""sociodemographic"", ""acculturation"", ""factor"", ""relationship"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""personal"", ""capital"", ""pregnancy"", ""exist"", ""however"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""e"", ""income"", ""education"", ""marital"", ""status"", ""completely"", ""explain"", ""black"", ""white"", ""disparity"", ""hispanic"", ""white"", ""disparity"", ""personal"", ""capital"", ""whereas"", ""acculturation"", ""factor"", ""especially"", ""nativity"", ""language"", ""speak"", ""home"", ""partially"", ""mediate"", ""disparity"", ""personal"", ""capital"", ""asian"", ""pacific"", ""islander"", ""woman"", ""white"", ""woman"", ""finding"", ""suggest"", ""risk"", ""associate"", ""low"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""single"", ""motherhood"", ""low"", ""acculturation"", ""rather"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""contribute"", ""low"", ""personal"", ""capital"", ""many"", ""pregnant"", ""woman"", ""personal"", ""capital"", ""pregnancy"", ""may"", ""influence"", ""subsequent"", ""maternal"", ""child"", ""health"", ""outcome"", ""development"", ""intervention"", ""consider"", ""address"", ""sociodemographic"", ""acculturation"", ""factor"", ""order"", ""reduce"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""personal"", ""capital"", ""ultimately"", ""poor"", ""maternal"", ""child"", ""health"", ""outcome""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,"Black, Asian, Hispanic"

Intersectional minority stress disparities among sexual minority adults in the USA: the role of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.,"Few studies have examined the intersection of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status on the experience of minority stressors among sexual minority adults. We examined whether there are differences in reports of minority stressors by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, and whether socioeconomic status moderates the associations between race/ethnicity and minority stressors. We analysed data from Project Stride, a community-based sample of 396 self-identified lesbian, gay and bisexual adults in New York City. We conducted a hierarchical multiple regression analysis to examine the associations between race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status on minority stressors. In adjusted models, African American and Latino sexual minority adults experienced greater anticipated stigma relative to their white counterparts. Socioeconomic status significantly moderated the association of race/ethnicity and enacted stigma. For African Americans, higher socioeconomic status was associated with more enacted stigma, whereas higher socioeconomic status was associated with reduced enacted stigma among whites. Minority stress processes are likely to operate differently for sexual minority people of colour compared with white sexual minority people, and for higher-socioeconomic status versus lower-socioeconomic status sexual minority people. Future research should consider the intersectional axes of identity that contribute to enacted stigma and disparities in mental and physical health, especially for US African American sexual minority adults.","Culture, health & sexuality","[""study"", ""examine"", ""intersection"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""experience"", ""minority"", ""stressor"", ""among"", ""sexual"", ""minority"", ""adult"", ""examine"", ""whether"", ""difference"", ""report"", ""minority"", ""stressor"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""whether"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""moderate"", ""association"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""minority"", ""stressor"", ""analyse"", ""data"", ""project"", ""stride"", ""community"", ""based"", ""sample"", ""396"", ""self"", ""identify"", ""lesbian"", ""gay"", ""bisexual"", ""adult"", ""new"", ""york"", ""city"", ""conduct"", ""hierarchical"", ""multiple"", ""regression"", ""analysis"", ""examine"", ""association"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""minority"", ""stressor"", ""adjust"", ""model"", ""african"", ""american"", ""latino"", ""sexual"", ""minority"", ""adult"", ""experience"", ""great"", ""anticipate"", ""stigma"", ""relative"", ""white"", ""counterpart"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""significantly"", ""moderate"", ""association"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""enact"", ""stigma"", ""african"", ""american"", ""high"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""associate"", ""enact"", ""stigma"", ""whereas"", ""high"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""associate"", ""reduce"", ""enact"", ""stigma"", ""among"", ""white"", ""minority"", ""stress"", ""process"", ""likely"", ""operate"", ""differently"", ""sexual"", ""minority"", ""people"", ""colour"", ""compare"", ""white"", ""sexual"", ""minority"", ""people"", ""high"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""versus"", ""low"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""sexual"", ""minority"", ""people"", ""future"", ""research"", ""consider"", ""intersectional"", ""axis"", ""identity"", ""contribute"", ""enact"", ""stigma"", ""disparity"", ""mental"", ""physical"", ""health"", ""especially"", ""we"", ""african"", ""american"", ""sexual"", ""minority"", ""adult""]",None,None,socioeconomic status,Latino

Demographic predictors of cognitive change in ethnically diverse older persons.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate how demographic variables relate to cognitive change and address whether cross-sectional demographic effects on cognitive tests are mirrored in differences in longitudinal trajectories of cognitive decline. We hypothesized that race and ethnicity, education, and language of test administration would relate to cross-sectional status and that the rate of cognitive decline would differ among African Americans, Hispanics, and Caucasians, across levels of educational attainment, and according to linguistic background. Participants were 404 educationally, ethnically, and cognitively diverse older adults enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal study of cognition. Mixed-effects regression analysis was used to measure baseline status and longitudinal change in episodic memory, executive functioning, and semantic memory. Results showed that ethnicity and education were strongly associated with baseline scores, but were, at most, weakly associated with change in cognition over time after accounting for confounding variables. There was evidence that the episodic-memory scores of Spanish-speaking Hispanic participants with limited education underestimated their true abilities in the initial evaluation, which may reflect lack of familiarity with the testing environment. These results--consistent with other reports in the literature--suggest that cross-sectional effects of demographic variables on cognitive-test scores result from differences in life experiences that directly influence test performance and do not indicate greater disease effects on cognition in minorities and those with limited education.",Psychology and aging,"[""purpose"", ""evaluate"", ""demographic"", ""variable"", ""relate"", ""cognitive"", ""change"", ""address"", ""whether"", ""cross"", ""sectional"", ""demographic"", ""effect"", ""cognitive"", ""test"", ""mirror"", ""difference"", ""longitudinal"", ""trajectory"", ""cognitive"", ""decline"", ""hypothesize"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""education"", ""language"", ""test"", ""administration"", ""would"", ""relate"", ""cross"", ""sectional"", ""status"", ""rate"", ""cognitive"", ""decline"", ""would"", ""differ"", ""among"", ""african"", ""american"", ""hispanic"", ""caucasian"", ""across"", ""level"", ""educational"", ""attainment"", ""accord"", ""linguistic"", ""background"", ""participant"", ""404"", ""educationally"", ""ethnically"", ""cognitively"", ""diverse"", ""old"", ""adult"", ""enrol"", ""ongoing"", ""longitudinal"", ""cognition"", ""mixed"", ""effect"", ""regression"", ""analysis"", ""use"", ""measure"", ""baseline"", ""status"", ""longitudinal"", ""change"", ""episodic"", ""memory"", ""executive"", ""function"", ""semantic"", ""memory"", ""show"", ""ethnicity"", ""education"", ""strongly"", ""associate"", ""baseline"", ""score"", ""weakly"", ""associate"", ""change"", ""cognition"", ""time"", ""account"", ""confounding"", ""variable"", ""evidence"", ""episodic"", ""memory"", ""score"", ""spanish"", ""speak"", ""hispanic"", ""participant"", ""limited"", ""education"", ""underestimate"", ""true"", ""ability"", ""initial"", ""evaluation"", ""may"", ""reflect"", ""lack"", ""familiarity"", ""testing"", ""environment"", ""consistent"", ""report"", ""literature"", ""suggest"", ""cross"", ""sectional"", ""effect"", ""demographic"", ""variable"", ""cognitive"", ""test"", ""score"", ""result"", ""difference"", ""life"", ""experience"", ""directly"", ""influence"", ""test"", ""performance"", ""indicate"", ""great"", ""disease"", ""effect"", ""cognition"", ""minority"", ""limited"", ""education""]",None,None,None,"Caucasian, Hispanic"

Race-related differences in acute pain complaints among inner-city women: the role of socioeconomic status.,"Previous research has shown that African Americans (AA) report higher pain intensity and pain interference than other racial/ethnic groups as well as greater levels of other risk factors related to worse pain outcomes, including PTSD symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and sleep disturbance. Within a Conservation of Resources theory framework, we tested the hypothesis that socioeconomic status (SES) factors (i.e., income, education, employment, perception of income meeting basic needs) largely account for these racial/ethnic differences. Participants were 435 women [AA, 59.1%; Hispanic/Latina (HL), 25.3%; Non-Hispanic/White (NHW), 15.6%] who presented to an Emergency Department (ED) with an acute pain-related complaint. Data were extracted from psychosocial questionnaires completed at the participants' baseline interview. Structural equation modeling was used to examine whether racial/ethnic differences in pain intensity and pain interference were mediated by PTSD symptoms, pain catastrophizing, sleep quality, and sleep duration, and whether these mediation pathways were, in turn, accounted for by SES factors. Results indicated that SES factors accounted for the mediation relationships linking AA race to pain intensity via PTSD symptoms and the mediation relationships linking AA race to pain interference via PTSD symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and sleep quality. Results suggested that observed racial/ethnic differences in AA women's pain intensity, pain interference, and common risk factors for elevated pain may be largely due to racial/ethnic differences in SES.

Prenatal risk factors among foreign-born Central American women: a comparative study.,"The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of empirically established prenatal risk factors for low birthweight (LBW) outcomes among two groups of low-income mothers: foreign-born Central American women and nonimmigrant, non-Hispanic women. Two hundred ninety-six women who were part of a larger study of maternal role sufficiency were included in the present study: 127 Central American women and 169 nonimmigrant, non-Hispanic women who identified themselves as Black (n = 59) or White (n = 110). Data were collected by public health nurses (PHNs) during home visits and by research nurses in prenatal health department clinics. Comparisons were made between the two groups in areas of demographic characteristics, prenatal health behaviors, and prenatal stressful life-events. Foreign-born Central American mothers were found to be less educated, more likely to be living with their partners, less likely to engage in prenatal health risk behaviors, and less likely to identify stressors in their lives. The initiation of prenatal PHN services by the target group was similar to the comparison group. Their rate of LBW deliveries did not reflect the protective effect often attributed to foreign-born Hispanic mothers. Findings are discussed in light of the paradox of LBW and Hispanic heritage.

Ethnic variations in the structure of borderline personality disorder symptomatology.,"The goal of this study was to examine differences in the factor structure of borderline personality disorder symptoms among different ethnic groups. The authors obtained information regarding ethnic identity and endorsement of borderline personality disorder criteria for an ethnically diverse community sample of 1140 young adult subjects from south Florida. Using this information the authors conducted an exploratory factor analysis examining differences between Caucasian, Hispanic and African American groups. A principal-components factor analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation for each ethnic group revealed a reasonably generalizable four-factor structure: affective dysregulation, cognitive disturbance, disturbed relatedness and behavioral dysregulation. The emergence of a four-factor structure across three separate, relatively large samples suggests that the factors obtained have merit. However, the loadings of some BPD symptoms, such as impulsivity, varied for each ethnic group. The results of this study indicate that ethnic variations in borderline personality disorder should be considered during assessment and treatment of this disorder. Also, future research should examine if this same factor structure holds for ethnic minorities with BPD diagnoses, examine ethnic differences in the etiology and maintenance of BPD symptomatology, and explore the effects that these differences might have in treatment settings.",Journal of psychiatric research,"[""goal"", ""examine"", ""difference"", ""factor"", ""structure"", ""borderline"", ""personality"", ""disorder"", ""symptom"", ""among"", ""different"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""author"", ""obtain"", ""information"", ""regard"", ""ethnic"", ""identity"", ""endorsement"", ""borderline"", ""personality"", ""disorder"", ""criterion"", ""ethnically"", ""diverse"", ""community"", ""sample"", ""1140"", ""young"", ""adult"", ""subject"", ""south"", ""florida"", ""use"", ""information"", ""author"", ""conduct"", ""exploratory"", ""factor"", ""analysis"", ""examine"", ""difference"", ""caucasian"", ""hispanic"", ""african"", ""american"", ""group"", ""principal"", ""component"", ""factor"", ""analysis"", ""pca"", ""varimax"", ""rotation"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""reveal"", ""reasonably"", ""generalizable"", ""four"", ""factor"", ""structure"", ""affective"", ""dysregulation"", ""cognitive"", ""disturbance"", ""disturb"", ""relatedness"", ""behavioral"", ""dysregulation"", ""emergence"", ""four"", ""factor"", ""structure"", ""across"", ""three"", ""separate"", ""relatively"", ""large"", ""sample"", ""suggest"", ""factor"", ""obtain"", ""merit"", ""however"", ""loading"", ""bpd"", ""symptom"", ""impulsivity"", ""varied"", ""ethnic"", ""group"", ""indicate"", ""ethnic"", ""variation"", ""borderline"", ""personality"", ""disorder"", ""consider"", ""assessment"", ""treatment"", ""disorder"", ""also"", ""future"", ""research"", ""examine"", ""factor"", ""structure"", ""hold"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""bpd"", ""diagnosis"", ""examine"", ""ethnic"", ""difference"", ""etiology"", ""maintenance"", ""bpd"", ""symptomatology"", ""explore"", ""effect"", ""difference"", ""might"", ""treatment"", ""setting""]",None,None,None,"Caucasian, Hispanic"
The Role of Intrinsic Motivation in the Pursuit of Health Science-Related Careers among Youth from Underrepresented Low Socioeconomic Populations.,"A more diverse health science-related workforce including more underrepresented race/ethnic minorities, especially from low socioeconomic backgrounds, is needed to address health disparities in the USA. To increase such diversity, programs must facilitate youth interest in pursuing a health science-related career (HSRC). Minority youth from low socioeconomic families may focus on the secondary gains of careers, such as high income and status, given their low socioeconomic backgrounds. On the other hand, self-determination theory suggests that it is the intrinsic characteristics of careers which are most likely to sustain pursuit of an HSRC and lead to job satisfaction. Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for pursuing an HSRC (defined in this study as health professional, health scientist, and medical doctor) was examined in a cohort of youth from the 10th to 12th grade from 2011 to 2013. The sample was from low-income area high schools, had a B- or above grade point average at baseline, and was predominantly: African American (65.7 %) or Hispanic (22.9 %), female (70.1 %), and children of foreign-born parents (64.7 %). In longitudinal general estimating equations, intrinsic motivation (but not extrinsic motivation) consistently predicted intention to pursue an HSRC.

Ethnic differences among adolescents beginning treatment for depression.,"This study examines ethnic/racial differences at the start of treatment among participants in the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS). African American and Latino youth were compared to Caucasian youth on symptom presentation and cognitive variables associated with depression. Contrary to hypothesis, there were no significant differences in symptom presentation as measured by the interview-based items of the Children's Depression Rating Scale--Revised (CDRS-R). However, African American and Latino youth were both rated as demonstrating more severe symptoms on the observational items of the CDRS-R compared to Caucasian youth.

Race and ethnicity reporting and representation in hemophilia clinical trials.,"Racial and ethnic representativeness in clinical trials is crucial to mitigate disparities in outcomes; however, diversity among hemophilia trials is unknown. The aim of this study is to examine the reporting and representation of race and ethnicity in trials of people with hemophilia (PwH). In this cross-sectional study, the ClinicalTrials.gov database was queried in April 2023 for interventional clinical trials involving PwH between 2007 and 2022. The distribution of participants (observed) was compared with expected proportions based on US Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC) and country-specific census data with observed-to-expected ratios (OERs). Of 129 trials included, 94.6% were industry sponsored, with a mean of 62 participants and mean age of 26.8 years. Overall, 52.0% (n = 66) of trials reported data on race and ethnicity, increasing from 13.9% in 2007-2012 to 22.5% in 2013-2016 to 100% in 2017-2022 (P = .001). Among these 66 trials, 65.8%, 22.8%, 5.1%, 3.9% of participants were White, Asian, Hispanic, and Black, respectively. OERs were 10% to 20% lower for White participants vs US HTC, and US, UK, and Canadian census populations and ∼75% lower for Black or Hispanic participants when compared with US HTC and US census population. OERs for Asian participants were 1.6 to 3 times higher than Canada, US, and UK census populations. The reporting of race and ethnicity in hemophilia trials has drastically improved; however, Black and Hispanic PwH remain especially underrepresented.

Macrosocial and environmental influences on minority health.,"Ethnic minority populations show patterns of health, health care use, and mortality that differ from the overall U.S. population. Each of the broad groups of minorities (Asian Hispanic, Native, and African Americans) has a unique background of sociocultural factors that influence these patterns. Thus, the larger social environment for ethnic populations, including political, environmental, historical, and economic factors, is a major variable in possible health outcomes.

Self-perceived emerging adult status and substance use.,"Very little research exists on how self-perceived emerging adult status is associated with substance use among low-income emerging adults. The Inventory of Dimensions of Emerging Adulthood (IDEA) was administered to emerging adults (EAs) ages 18-25 screened for substance use problems (n = l05) in a state-subsidized, not-for-profit treatment agency. We examined whether the defining dimensions of Arnett's (2000a) emerging adulthood theory were associated with substance use frequency and substance-related problems, including: identity exploration, self-focus, possibilities, optimism, negativity/instability, and feeling in-between. In multivariate models, feeling in-between was positively associated with substance-related problems.

Racial and ethnic disparities in access to liver transplantation.,"Access to liver transplantation is reportedly inequitable for racial/ethnic minorities, but inadequate adjustments for geography and disease progression preclude any meaningful conclusions. We aimed to evaluate the association between candidate race/ethnicity and liver transplant rates after thorough adjustments for these factors and to determine how uniform racial/ethnic disparities were across Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. Chronic end-stage liver disease candidates initially wait-listed between February 28, 2002 and February 27, 2007 were identified from Scientific Registry for Transplant Recipients data. The primary outcome was deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT); the primary exposure covariate was race/ethnicity (white, African American, Hispanic, Asian, and other). Cox regression was used to estimate the covariate-adjusted DDLT rates by race/ethnicity, which were stratified by the donation service area and MELD score. With averaging across all MELD scores, African Americans, Asians, and others had similar adjusted DDLT rates in comparison with whites. However, Hispanics had an 8% lower DDLT rate versus whites [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.92, P = 0.011]. The disparity among Hispanics was concentrated among patients with MELD scores < 20, with HR = 0.84 (P = 0.021) for MELD scores of 6 to 14 and HR = 0.85 (P = 0.009) for MELD scores of 15 to 19. Asians with MELD scores < 15 had a 24% higher DDLT rate with respect to whites (HR = 1.24, P = 0.024). However, Asians with MELD scores of 30 to 40 had a 46% lower DDLT rate (HR = 0.54, P = 0.004). In conclusion, although African Americans did not have significantly different DDLT rates in comparison with similar white candidates, race/ethnicity-based disparities were prominent among subgroups of Hispanic and Asian candidates. By precluding the survival benefit of liver transplantation, this inequity may lead to excess mortality for minority candidates.",Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,"[""access"", ""liver"", ""transplantation"", ""reportedly"", ""inequitable"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""minority"", ""inadequate"", ""adjustment"", ""geography"", ""disease"", ""progression"", ""preclude"", ""meaningful"", ""conclusion"", ""aim"", ""evaluate"", ""association"", ""candidate"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""liver"", ""transplant"", ""rate"", ""thorough"", ""adjustment"", ""factor"", ""determine"", ""uniform"", ""racial"", ""ethnic"", ""disparity"", ""across"", ""model"", ""end"", ""stage"", ""liver"", ""disease"", ""meld"", ""score"", ""chronic"", ""end"", ""stage"", ""liver"", ""disease"", ""candidate"", ""initially"", ""wait"", ""list"", ""february"", ""28"", ""2002"", ""february"", ""27"", ""2007"", ""identify"", ""scientific"", ""registry"", ""transplant"", ""recipient"", ""data"", ""primary"", ""outcome"", ""deceased"", ""donor"", ""liver"", ""transplantation"", ""ddlt"", ""primary"", ""exposure"", ""covariate"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""white"", ""african"", ""american"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""cox"", ""regression"", ""use"", ""estimate"", ""covariate"", ""adjust"", ""ddlt"", ""rate"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""stratify"", ""donation"", ""service"", ""area"", ""meld"", ""score"", ""average"", ""across"", ""meld"", ""score"", ""african"", ""american"", ""asian"", ""other"", ""similar"", ""adjusted"", ""ddlt"", ""rate"", ""comparison"", ""white"", ""however"", ""hispanic"", ""8"", ""low"", ""ddlt"", ""rate"", ""versus"", ""white"", ""hazard"", ""ratio"", ""hr"", ""0"", ""92"", ""p"", ""0"", ""011"", ""disparity"", ""among"", ""hispanic"", ""concentrate"", ""among"", ""patient"", ""meld"", ""score"", ""20"", ""hr"", ""0"", ""84"", ""p"", ""0"", ""021"", ""meld"", ""score"", ""6"", ""14"", ""hr"", ""0"", ""85"", ""p"", ""0"", ""009"", ""meld"", ""score"", ""15"", ""19"", ""asian"", ""meld"", ""score"", ""15"", ""24"", ""high"", ""ddlt"", ""rate"", ""respect"", ""white"", ""hr"", ""1"", ""24"", ""p"", ""0"", ""024"", ""however"", ""asian"", ""meld"", ""score"", ""30"", ""40"", ""46"", ""low"", ""ddlt"", ""rate"", ""hr"", ""0"", ""54"", ""p"", ""0"", ""004"", ""conclusion"", ""although"", ""african"", ""american"", ""significantly"", ""different"", ""ddlt"", ""rate"", ""comparison"", ""similar"", ""white"", ""candidate"", ""race"", ""ethnicity"", ""base"", ""disparity"", ""prominent"", ""among"", ""subgroup"", ""hispanic"", ""asian"", ""candidate"", ""preclude"", ""survival"", ""benefit"", ""liver"", ""transplantation"", ""inequity"", ""may"", ""lead"", ""excess"", ""mortality"", ""minority"", ""candidate""]",None,aging,None,"Asian, Hispanic"

Epigenetic clocks may come out of rhythm-implications for the estimation of chronological age in forensic casework.,"There is a growing perception that DNA methylation may be influenced by exogenous and endogenous parameters. Knowledge of these factors is of great relevance for the interpretation of DNA-methylation data for the estimation of chronological age in forensic casework. We performed a literature review to identify parameters, which might be of relevance for the prediction of chronological age based on DNA methylation. The quality of age predictions might particularly be influenced by lifetime adversities (chronic stress, trauma/post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), violence, low socioeconomic status/education), cancer, obesity and related diseases, infectious diseases (especially HIV and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections), sex, ethnicity and exposure to toxins (alcohol, smoking, air pollution, pesticides). Such factors may alter the DNA methylation pattern and may explain the partly high deviations between epigenetic age and chronological age in single cases (despite of low mean absolute deviations) that can also be observed with ""epigenetic clocks"" comprising a high number of CpG sites. So far, only few publications dealing with forensic age estimation address these confounding factors.

Methylation of the oxytocin receptor gene mediates the effect of adversity on negative schemas and depression.,"Building upon various lines of research, we posited that methylation of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) would mediate the effect of adult adversity on increased commitment to negative schemas and in turn the development of depression. We tested our model using structural equation modeling and longitudinal data from a sample of 100 middle-aged, African American women. The results provided strong support for the model. Analysis of the 12 CpG sites available for the promoter region of the OXTR gene identified four factors. One of these factors was related to the study variables, whereas the others were not. This factor mediated the effect of adult adversity on schemas relating to pessimism and distrust, and these schemas, in turn, mediated the impact of OXTR methylation on depression. All indirect effects were statistically significant, and they remained significant after controlling for childhood trauma, age, romantic relationship status, individual differences in cell types, and average level of genome-wide methylation.

Problematic alcohol use associates with sodium channel and clathrin linker 1 (SCLT1) in trauma-exposed populations.,"Excessive alcohol use is extremely prevalent in the United States, particularly among trauma-exposed individuals. While several studies have examined genetic influences on alcohol use and related problems, this has not been studied in the context of trauma-exposed populations. We report results from a genome-wide association study of alcohol consumption and associated problems as measured by the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) in a trauma-exposed cohort. Results indicate a genome-wide significant association between total AUDIT score and rs1433375 [N = 1036, P = 2.61 × 10<sup>-8</sup> (dominant model), P = 7.76 × 10<sup>-8</sup> (additive model)], an intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphism located 323 kb upstream of the sodium channel and clathrin linker 1 (SCLT1) at 4q28. rs1433375 was also significant in a meta-analysis of two similar, but independent, cohorts (N = 1394, P = 0.0004), the Marine Resiliency Study and Systems Biology PTSD Biomarkers Consortium. Functional analysis indicated that rs1433375 was associated with SCLT1 gene expression and cortical-cerebellar functional connectivity measured via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Together, findings suggest a role for sodium channel regulation and cerebellar functioning in alcohol use behavior.

Using polymorphisms in FKBP5 to define biologically distinct subtypes of posttraumatic stress disorder: evidence from endocrine and gene expression studies.,Polymorphisms in the gene encoding the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulating co-chaperone FKBP5 have been shown to alter GR sensitivity and are associated with an increased risk to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).,Archives of general psychiatry,"[""polymorphism"", ""gene"", ""encode"", ""glucocorticoid"", ""receptor"", ""regulate"", ""chaperone"", ""show"", ""alter"", ""sensitivity"", ""associate"", ""increase"", ""risk"", ""develop"", ""posttraumatic"", ""stress"", ""disorder"", ""ptsd""]",PTSD,None,None,None
Influence of child abuse on adult depression: moderation by the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor gene.,"Genetic inheritance and developmental life stress both contribute to major depressive disorder in adults.

Molecular variation at the SLC6A3 locus predicts lifetime risk of PTSD in the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study.,"Recent work suggests that the 9-repeat (9R) allele located in the 3'UTR VNTR of the SLC6A3 gene increases risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, no study reporting this association to date has been based on population-based samples. Furthermore, no study of which we are aware has assessed the joint action of genetic and DNA methylation variation at SLC6A3 on risk of PTSD. In this study, we assessed whether molecular variation at SLC6A3 locus influences risk of PTSD. Participants (n = 320; 62 cases/258 controls) were drawn from an urban, community-based sample of predominantly African American Detroit adult residents, and included those who had completed a baseline telephone survey, had provided blood specimens, and had a homozygous genotype for either the 9R or 10R allele or a heterozygous 9R/10R genotype. The influence of DNA methylation variation in the SLC6A3 promoter locus was also assessed in a subset of participants with available methylation data (n = 83; 16 cases/67 controls). In the full analytic sample, 9R allele carriers had almost double the risk of lifetime PTSD compared to 10R/10R genotype carriers (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.02-3.86), controlling for age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, number of traumas, smoking, and lifetime depression. In the subsample of participants with available methylation data, a significant (p = 0.008) interaction was observed whereby 9R allele carriers showed an increased risk of lifetime PTSD only in conjunction with high methylation in the SLC6A3 promoter locus, controlling for the same covariates. Our results confirm previous reports supporting a role for the 9R allele in increasing susceptibility to PTSD. They further extend these findings by providing preliminary evidence that a ""double hit"" model, including both a putatively reduced-function allele and high methylation in the promoter region, may more accurately capture molecular risk of PTSD at the SLC6A3 locus.",PloS one,"[""recent"", ""work"", ""suggest"", ""repeat"", ""allele"", ""located"", ""utr"", ""vntr"", ""gene"", ""increase"", ""risk"", ""posttraumatic"", ""stress"", ""disorder"", ""ptsd"", ""however"", ""report"", ""association"", ""date"", ""base"", ""population"", ""base"", ""sample"", ""furthermore"", ""aware"", ""assess"", ""joint"", ""action"", ""genetic"", ""dna"", ""methylation"", ""variation"", ""risk"", ""ptsd"", ""assess"", ""whether"", ""molecular"", ""variation"", ""locus"", ""influence"", ""risk"", ""ptsd"", ""participant"", ""case"", ""control"", ""draw"", ""urban"", ""community"", ""based"", ""sample"", ""predominantly"", ""african"", ""american"", ""detroit"", ""adult"", ""resident"", ""include"", ""complete"", ""baseline"", ""telephone"", ""survey"", ""provide"", ""blood"", ""specimen"", ""homozygous"", ""genotype"", ""either"", ""allele"", ""heterozygous"", ""genotype"", ""influence"", ""dna"", ""methylation"", ""variation"", ""promoter"", ""locus"", ""also"", ""assess"", ""subset"", ""participant"", ""available"", ""methylation"", ""data"", ""case"", ""control"", ""full"", ""analytic"", ""sample"", ""allele"", ""carrier"", ""almost"", ""double"", ""risk"", ""lifetime"", ""ptsd"", ""compare"", ""genotype"", ""carrier"", ""control"", ""age"", ""sex"", ""race"", ""socioeconomic"", ""status"", ""number"", ""trauma"", ""smoke"", ""lifetime"", ""depression"", ""subsample"", ""participant"", ""available"", ""methylation"", ""data"", ""interaction"", ""observe"", ""whereby"", ""allele"", ""carrier"", ""show"", ""increase"", ""risk"", ""lifetime"", ""ptsd"", ""conjunction"", ""high"", ""methylation"", ""promoter"", ""locus"", ""controlling"", ""covariate"", ""confirm"", ""previous"", ""report"", ""support"", ""role"", ""allele"", ""increase"", ""susceptibility"", ""ptsd"", ""extend"", ""finding"", ""provide"", ""preliminary"", ""evidence"", ""double"", ""hit"", ""model"", ""include"", ""putatively"", ""reduce"", ""function"", ""allele"", ""high"", ""methylation"", ""promoter"", ""region"", ""may"", ""accurately"", ""capture"", ""molecular"", ""risk"", ""ptsd"", ""locus""]","depression, PTSD",DNA methylation,socioeconomic status,"race, African American"
